abstract = {Multi-vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (MVRPSTW) is an indispensable constituent in urban logistics distribution systems. Over the past decade, numerous methods for MVRPSTW have been proposed, but most are based on heuristic rules that require a large amount of computation time. With the current rapid increase of logistics demands, traditional methods incur the dilemma between computational efficiency and solution quality. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called the Multi-Agent Attention Model that can solve routing problem instantly benefit from lengthy offline training. Specifically, the vehicle routing problem is regarded as a vehicle tour generation process, and an encoder-decoder framework with attention layers is proposed to generate tours of multiple vehicles iteratively. Furthermore, a multi-agent reinforcement learning method with an unsupervised auxiliary network is developed for the model training. By evaluated on four synthetic networks with different scales, the results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms Google OR-Tools and traditional methods with little computation time. In addition, we validate the robustness of the well-trained model by varying the number of customers and the capacities of vehicles.}

To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of driving experiments are conducted in both controlled and “free-driving” conditions. In all experiments, the smartphone can be freely positioned inside the subject vehicle.

First, we thoroughly investigate the 1-year over 3 million tweet contents in two metropolitan areas: Northern Virginia and New York City. Our results show that paired tokens can capture the association rules inherent in the accident-related tweets and further increase the accuracy of the traffic accident detection. Second, two deep learning methods: Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are investigated and implemented on the extracted token. Results show that DBN can obtain an overall accuracy of 85% with about 44 individual token features and 17 paired token features. The classification results from DBN outperform those of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and supervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA). Finally, to validate this study, we compare the accident-related tweets with both the traffic accident log on freeways and traffic data on local roads from 15,000 loop detectors. It is found that nearly 66% of the accident-related tweets can be located by the accident log and more than 80% of them can be tied to nearby abnormal traffic data. Several important issues of using Twitter to detect traffic accidents have been brought up by the comparison including the location and time bias, as well as the characteristics of influential users and hashtags.}

This paper aims to model the multi-driver repositioning task through a mean field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that captures competition among multiple agents. Because the direct application of MARL to the multi-driver system under a given reward mechanism will likely yield a suboptimal equilibrium due to the selfishness of drivers, this study proposes a reward design scheme with which a more desired equilibrium can be reached. To effectively solve the bilevel optimization problem with upper level as the reward design and the lower level as a multi-agent system, a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is adopted to speed up the learning process. We then apply the bilevel optimization model to two case studies, namely, e-hailing driver repositioning under service charge and multiclass taxi driver repositioning under NYC congestion pricing. In the first case study, the model is validated by the agreement between the derived optimal control from BO and that from an analytical solution. With a simple piecewise linear service charge, the objective of the e-hailing platform can be increased by 8.4%. In the second case study, an optimal toll charge of $5.1 is solved using BO, which improves the objective of city planners by 7.9%, compared to that without any toll charge. Under this optimal toll charge, the number of taxis in the NYC central business district is decreased, indicating a better traffic condition, without substantially increasing the crowdedness of the subway system.}

A sequence to sequence model embedded with the attention mechanism forms the backbone of this framework. The sequence to sequence model consists of an encoder network and a decoder network, making it good at modeling sequential data with varying lengths and the attention mechanism further enhances its ability to capture long-range dependencies. We use the proposed framework to predict the number of passengers alighting at each station in the near future, given the number of passengers boarding at each station in the last few short-term periods. The large quantities of real-world data collected from Singapore’s metro system are used to validate the proposed model. In addition, a set of comparisons made among our model and other classical approaches evidently indicates that the proposed model is more scalable and robust than other baselines in making multi-step and network-wide predictions for short-term passenger flow.}

The agent’s mobility is considered in a broader context, which allows the activity-based models to produce more realistic trip chains, compared to traditional trip-based models. The core of any activity-based model is an activity scheduler – a software component producing sequences of agent’s daily activities interconnected by trips, called activity schedules. Traditionally, activity schedulers used to rely heavily on hard-coded knowledge of transport behaviour experts. We introduce the concept of a Data-Driven Activity Scheduler (DDAS), which replaces numerous expert-designed components and their intricately engineered interactions with a collection of machine learning models. Its architecture is significantly simpler, making it easier to deploy and maintain. This shift towards data-driven, machine learning based approach is possible due to increased availability of mobility-related data. We demonstrate DDAS concept using our own proof-of-concept implementation, perform a rigorous analysis and compare the validity of the resulting model to one of the rule-based alternatives using the Validation Framework for Activity-Based Models (VALFRAM).}

Therefore, a framework of the decision-making training and learning is put forward in this paper. It consists of two parts: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training program and the high-fidelity virtual simulation environment. Then the basic microscopic behavior, car-following (CF), is trained within this framework. In addition, theoretical analysis and experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed reward functions for accelerating training using DRL. The results show that on the premise of driving comfort, the efficiency of the trained AV increases 7.9% and 3.8% respectively compared to the classical adaptive cruise control models, intelligent driver model and constant-time headway policy. Moreover, on a more complex three-lane section, we trained an integrated model combining both CF and lane-changing behavior, with the average speed further growing 2.4%.

Variable runtimes pose significant operational challenges if the nature of runtime variability is not predictable. To address this issue, this article proposes a data-driven approach to predict estimated times of arrival (ETAs) of individual freight trains, based on the properties of the train, the properties of the network, and the properties of potentially conflicting traffic on the network. The ETA prediction problem from an origin to a destination is posed as a machine learning regression problem and solved using support vector regression trained and cross validated on over two years of detailed historical data for a 140 mile section of track located primarily in Tennessee, USA. The article presents the data used in this problem and details on feature engineering and construction for predictions made across the full route. It also highlights findings on the dominant sources of runtime variability and the most predictive factors for ETA. Improvement results for ETA exceed 21% over a baseline prediction method at some locations and average 14% across the study area.}

The empirical LC data provided by Next Generation Simulation project (NGSIM) is utilized to train and test the proposed DBN-based LCD model and LSTM-based LCI model. The results indicate that the proposed data-driven model is able to accurately predict the LC process of a vehicle. The sensitivity analysis shows that the most important factor associated with LCD is the relative position of the preceding vehicle in the target lane. This may be the first work that comprehensively models LC using deep learning approaches.}

We have developed a system that infers crew scheduling constraints from historical crew schedules with the assistance of a domain expert. This system implements the ComCon algorithm developed to learn constraints that prescribe the limits of certain aspects of crew schedules. The algorithm induces complex multivariate constraints based on a set of user provided templates that outline the general structure of important constraints. The results of an evaluation conducted with crew schedules from two commercial airlines show that the system is capable of learning the majority of the minimum rest constraints.}

The integration of autonomous vehicles, such as drones, in the last-mile network design can curtail many operational challenges and provide a competitive advantage. This paper deals with the problem of delivering orders to a set of customer locations using multiple drones that operate in conjunction with a single truck. To take advantage of the drone fleet, the delivery tasks are parallelized by concurrently dispatching the drones from a truck parked at a focal point (ideal drone launch location) to the nearby customer locations. Hence, the key decisions to be optimized are the partitioning of delivery locations into small clusters, identifying a focal point per cluster, and routing the truck through all focal points such that the customer orders in each cluster are fulfilled either by a drone or truck. In contrast to prior studies that tackle this problem using multi-phase sequential procedures, this paper presents mathematical programming models to jointly optimize all the decisions involved. We also consider two polices for choosing a cluster focal point - (i) restricting it to one of the customer locations, and (ii) allowing it to be anywhere in the delivery area (i.e., a customer or non-customer location). Since the models considering unrestricted focal points are computationally expensive, an unsupervised machine learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution time. Initially, we treat the problem as a single objective by independently minimizing either the total cost or delivery completion time. Subsequently, the two conflicting objectives are considered together for obtaining the set of best trade-off solutions. An extensive computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of restricting the focal points, and the influence of adopting a joint optimization method instead of a sequential approach. Finally, several key insights are obtained to aid the logistics practitioners in decision making.}

A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is designed to learn the continuous longitudinal acceleration/deceleration to reduce the fuel consumption as well as to maintain acceptable travel time. Collecting the critic’s value of each single lane from DDPG and integrating the information of adjacent lanes, a deep Q-learning algorithm is developed to make the discrete lane-changing decision. Together, a hybrid deep Q-learning and policy gradient (HDQPG) method is developed for vehicles driving along multi-lane urban signalized corridors. The method can enable the controlled vehicle to learn well-established longitudinal fuel-saving strategies, and to perform appropriate lane-changing operations at proper times to avoid congested lanes. Numerical experiments show that HDQPG can reduce fuel consumption by up to 46% with marginal or no increase of travel times.}

abstract = {Real-time traffic crash prediction has been a major concern in the development of Collision Avoidance Systems (CASs) along with other intelligent and resilient transportation technologies. There has been a pronounced progress in the use of machine learning models for crash events assessment by the transportation safety research community in recent years. However, little attention has been paid so far to evaluating real-time crash occurrences within information fusion systems. The main aim of this paper is to design and validate an ensemble fusion framework founded on the use of various base classifiers that operate on fused features and a Meta classifier that learns from base classifiers’ results to acquire more performant crash predictions. A data-driven approach was adopted to investigate the potential of fusing four real-time and continuous categories of features namely physiological signals, driver maneuvering inputs, vehicle kinematics and weather covariates in order to systematically identify the crash strongest precursors through feature selection techniques. Moreover, a resampling-based scheme, including Bagging and Boosting, is conducted to generate diversity in learner combinations comprising Bayesian Learners (BL), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). To ensure that the proposed framework provide powerful and stable decisions, an imbalance-learning strategy was adopted using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance problem as crash events usually occur in rare instances. The findings show that Boosting depicted the highest performance within the fusion scheme and can accomplish a maximum of 93.66% F1 score and 94.81% G-mean with Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Networks, k-NN and SVM with MLP as the Meta-classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first attempt at establishing a fusing framework on the basis of data from the four aforementioned categories and fusion models while accounting for class imbalance. Overall, the method and findings provide new insights into crash prediction and can be harnessed as a promising tool to improve intervention efforts related to traffic intelligent transportation systems.}

This research studies two particular problems in traffic forecasting: (1) capture the dynamic and non-local spatial correlation between traffic links and (2) model the dynamics of temporal dependency for accurate multiple steps ahead predictions. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning framework named Spatial-Temporal Sequence to Sequence model (STSeq2Seq). This model builds on sequence to sequence (seq2seq) architecture to capture temporal feature and relies on graph convolution for aggregating spatial information. Moreover, STSeq2Seq defines and constructs Pattern-aware Adjacency Matrix (PAM) based on pair-wise similarity of the recent traffic patterns on traffic links and integrates it into graph convolution operation. It also deploys a novel seq2sesq architecture which couples a convolutional encoder and a recurrent decoder with attention mechanism for dynamic modeling of long-range dependence between different time steps. We conduct extensive experiments using two publicly-available large-scale traffic datasets and compare STSeq2Seq with other baseline models. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in terms of various error measures. The ablation study verifies the effectiveness of PAMs in capturing dynamic non-local spatial correlation and the superiority of proposed seq2seq architecture in modeling non-stationary temporal dependency for multiple steps ahead prediction. Furthermore, qualitative analysis is conducted on PAMs as well as the attention weights for model interpretation.}

The spatial and temporal analyses were first conducted to investigate the mobility pattern of the station-free bike sharing. The result indicates the imbalanced spatial and temporal demand of bike sharing trips.

The validation results suggested that the developed LSTM NNs have reasonable good prediction accuracy in trip productions and attractions for different time intervals. The statistical models and recently developed machine learning methods were also developed to benchmark the LSTM NN. The comparison results suggested that the LSTM NNs provide better prediction accuracy than both conventional statistical models and advanced machine learning methods for different time intervals.

The main contribution is development of an architecture that combines a linear model that is fitted using ℓ1 regularization and a sequence of tanh layers. The challenge of predicting traffic flows are the sharp nonlinearities due to transitions between free flow, breakdown, recovery and congestion. We show that deep learning architectures can capture these nonlinear spatio-temporal effects. The first layer identifies spatio-temporal relations among predictors and other layers model nonlinear relations. We illustrate our methodology on road sensor data from Interstate I-55 and predict traffic flows during two special events; a Chicago Bears football game and an extreme snowstorm event. Both cases have sharp traffic flow regime changes, occurring very suddenly, and we show how deep learning provides precise short term traffic flow predictions.}

abstract = {Short-term passenger demand forecasting is of great importance to the on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies, and exogenous dependencies need to be considered simultaneously, however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependencies within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection. The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China. The experimental results, validated on the real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing, show that the FCL-Net achieves the better predictive performance than traditional approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and state-of-art machine learning algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network, XGBoost, LSTM and CNN). Furthermore, the consideration of exogenous variables in addition to the passenger demand itself, such as the travel time rate, time-of-day, day-of-week, and weather conditions, is proven to be promising, since they reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 48.3%. It is also interesting to find that the feature selection reduces 24.4% in the training time and leads to only the 1.8% loss in the forecasting accuracy measured by RMSE in the proposed model. This paper is one of the first DL studies to forecast the short-term passenger demand of an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal correlations.}

With the advent of ubiquitous GPS-enabled devices (e.g., a smartphone), a cost-effective approach for inferring commuters’ mobility mode(s) is to leverage their GPS trajectories. A majority of studies have proposed mode inference models based on hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning algorithms. However, manual features engender some major drawbacks including vulnerability to traffic and environmental conditions as well as possessing human’s bias in creating efficient features. One way to overcome these issues is by utilizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) schemes that are capable of automatically driving high-level features from the raw input. Accordingly, in this paper, we take advantage of CNN architectures so as to predict travel modes based on only raw GPS trajectories, where the modes are labeled as walk, bike, bus, driving, and train. Our key contribution is designing the layout of the CNN’s input layer in such a way that not only is adaptable with the CNN schemes but represents fundamental motion characteristics of a moving object including speed, acceleration, jerk, and bearing rate. Furthermore, we ameliorate the quality of GPS logs through several data preprocessing steps. Using the clean input layer, a variety of CNN configurations are evaluated to achieve the best CNN architecture. The highest accuracy of 84.8% has been achieved through the ensemble of the best CNN configuration. In this research, we contrast our methodology with traditional machine learning algorithms as well as the seminal and most related studies to demonstrate the superiority of our framework.}

Of these, air traffic management in the multi-airport (metroplex) terminal airspace is one of the most complicated subsystems to manage, especially due to the interactions between proximal airports. Analyzing anomalous behaviors in the metroplex is emerging as a key problem in understanding air traffic management complexity and safety. Although physics-based approaches have been studied in-depth for this application, newfound interest has been observed to use recorded time-series air traffic surveillance and airport operations datasets for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithm that generates mathematical models to detect anomalies in metroplex operations. Several machine learning algorithms have been developed to detect anomalies using only air traffic surveillance data, but there is a significant scope of improvement by including airport operational characteristics as well, since integrating such closely-controlled metroplex operational datasets allows the developed models to effectively detect anomalies. The key contribution of this paper is in allowing anomaly detection models to recursively update so as to adapt to changes in metroplex operations. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated with real air traffic surveillance and airport operations datasets at LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy, and Newark airports, thereby detecting anomalies for operations in the New York metroplex.}

Logarithmic multivariate Gaussian models are trained to evaluate the performance of aircrafts at different flight phases (takeoff, ascent, cruise, etc.) separately. By including a forward synchronization, feature selection, and mini-batch training process, this model overcomes challenges introduced by the large size and high dimensionality of flight datasets. This framework also addresses the re-sampling issue in existing literature causing difficulties in handling time-series signals with different lengths. For demonstration and validation, the developed model is applied to analyze performance anomalies associated with the mechanical system and pilot operation in a historical flight dataset. Compared with existing literature focusing on similar datasets, this evaluation methodology shows promise in detecting performance anomalies especially at approach and takeoff phases. Therefore, the developed model is expected to be an effective addition to the current anomaly analysis and monitoring technologies for scheduled commercial flights. Applications include assisting transportation management systems by handling large amounts of historical flight datasets to analyze mechanical and operational anomalies, which may potentially improve future aeronautical system design and pilot training.}

Asa special structure of deep neural network (DNN), an autoencoder can deeply and abstractly extract the nonlinear features embedded in the input without any labels. By exploiting its remarkable capabilities, a novel hourly passenger flow prediction model using deep learning methods is proposed in this paper. Temporal features including the day of a week, the hour of a day, and holidays, the scenario features including inbound and outbound, and tickets and cards, and the passenger flow features including the previous average passenger flow and real-time passenger flow, are defined as the input features. These features are combined and trained as different stacked autoencoders (SAE) in the first stage. Then, the pre-trained SAE are further used to initialize the supervised DNN with the real-time passenger flow as the label data in the second stage. The hybrid model (SAE-DNN) is applied and evaluated with a case study of passenger flow prediction for four bus rapid transit (BRT) stations of Xiamen in the third stage. The experimental results show that the proposed method has the capability to provide a more accurate and universal passenger flow prediction model for different BRT stations with different passenger flow profiles.}

This study investigates pedestrian crossing behaviour which, as an important element of urban dynamics, is expected to be affected by the presence of automated vehicles. For this purpose, an interpretable machine learning framework is proposed to explore factors affecting pedestrians’ wait time before crossing mid-block crosswalks in the presence of automated vehicles. To collect rich behavioural data, we developed a dynamic and immersive virtual reality experiment, with 180 participants from a heterogeneous population in 4 different locations in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Pedestrian wait time behaviour is then analysed using a data-driven Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model, in which the linear combination of the covariates is replaced by a flexible non-linear deep neural network. The proposed model achieved a 5% improvement in goodness of fit, but more importantly, enabled us to incorporate a richer set of covariates. A game theoretic based interpretability method is used to understand the contribution of different covariates to the time pedestrians wait before crossing. Results show that the presence of automated vehicles on roads, wider lane widths, high density on roads, limited sight distance, and lack of walking habits are the main contributing factors to longer wait times. Our study suggested that, to move towards pedestrian-friendly urban areas, educational programs for children, enhanced safety measures for seniors, promotion of active modes of transportation, and revised traffic rules and regulations should be considered.}

As an innovation compared with the posterior LC risk prediction methods proposed in previous studies, this study develops a pre-emptive LC risk level prediction (P-LRLP) method, which is able to estimate the crash risk level of an LC event in advance before the LC car completes the LC maneuver. The basic concept of this method is to apply a machine learning classifier to predict the LC risk level based on cars’ key space-series features at the beginning of the LC event. To boost the prediction performance, an innovative resampling method, namely ENN-SMOTE-Tomek Link (EST), and an advanced machine learning classifier, namely LightGBM, are proposed and employed in the development of the P-LRLP method. Meanwhile, an algorithm which can measure the stability of the selected key features in terms of the randomness and size of training samples is developed to evaluate the feature selection methods. A digitalized vehicles’ trajectory dataset, the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) is used for method validation. The validation results manifest that the EST can achieve satisfactory resampling performance while Random Forest (RF), as an embedded FS method, achieves remarkable performance on both stability of selected features and prediction of risk level. The results also show that the LC risk level can be most accurately predicted when the LC car moves to the position where the distance between the longitudinal center line of the LC car and the marking line separating the two lanes equals 1.5ft. As an innovative LC risk level prediction technique, the P-LRLP method could be integrated with advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to remedy potential risky LC maneuver in the future.}

Many studies have used machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in vehicle trajectories to predict location sequences of individual travelers. Unlike the previous studies that used a discriminative modeling approach, this research suggests a generative modeling approach to learn the underlying distributions of urban vehicle trajectory data. A generative model for urban vehicle trajectories can better generalize from training data by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and, thus, produce synthetic vehicle trajectories similar to real vehicle trajectories with limited observations. Synthetic trajectories can provide solutions to data sparsity or data privacy issues in using location data. This research proposes TrajGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for the urban vehicle trajectory generation. In TrajGAIL, learning location sequences in observed trajectories is formulated as an imitation learning problem in a partially observable Markov decision process. The model is trained by the generative adversarial framework, which uses the reward function from the adversarial discriminator. The model is tested with both simulation and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model obtained significant performance gains compared to existing models in sequence modeling.}

A safe and efficient prediction is a prerequisite to the implementation of automated tools that detect and solve conflicts between trajectories. This paper focuses on the climb phase, because predictions are much less accurate in this phase than in the cruising phase. Trajectory prediction usually relies on a point-mass model of the forces acting on the aircraft to predict the successive points of the future trajectory. The longitudinal acceleration and climb rate are determined by an equation relating the modeled power of the forces to the kinetic and potential energy rate. Using such a model requires knowledge of the aircraft state (mass, current thrust setting, position, velocity, etc.), atmospheric conditions (wind, temperature) and aircraft intent (thrust law, speed intent). Most of this information is not available to ground-based systems. In this paper, we improve the trajectory prediction accuracy by learning some of the unknown point-mass model parameters from past observations. These unknown parameters, mass and thrust, are adjusted by fitting the modeled specific power to the observed energy rate. The thrust law is learned from historical data, and the mass is estimated on past trajectory points. The adjusted parameters are not meant to be exact, however they are designed so as to improve the energy rate prediction. The performances of the proposed method are compared with the results of standard model-based methods relying on the Eurocontrol Base of Aircraft DAta (BADA), using two months of radar track records and weather data.}

In this study, a network-level sidewalk inventory method is proposed by efficiently segmenting the mobile light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data using a customized deep neural network, i.e., PointNet++, and followed by integrating a stripe-based sidewalk extraction algorithm. By extracting the sidewalk locations from the mobile LiDAR point cloud, the corresponding geometry features, e.g., width, grade, cross slope, etc., can be extracted for the ADA compliance and the overall condition assessment. The experimental test conducted on the entire State Route 9, Massachusetts has shown promising performance in terms of the accuracy for the sidewalk extraction (i.e., point-level intersect over union (IoU) value of 0.946) and the efficiency for network analysis of the ADA compliance (i.e., approximately 6.5 min/mile). A case study conducted in Columbus District in Boston, Massachusetts, demonstrates that the proposed method can not only successfully support transportation agencies with an accurate and efficient means for network-level sidewalk inventory, but also support wheelchair users with accurate and comprehensive sidewalk inventory information for better navigation and route planning.}

The operation complexity of a sector plays a critical role in the current Air Traffic Management system, e.g. it determines the workload volume of air traffic controllers and serves as a reliable index for airspace configuration and traffic flow management. Therefore, accurately evaluating the sector operation complexity is a problem of paramount importance in both practice and research. Due to numerous interacting factors, traditional methods based on only one single complexity indicator fail to accurately reflect the true complexity, especially when these factors are nonlinearly correlated. In light of these, the attempt to use machine learning models to mine the complex factor-complexity relationship has prevailed recently. The performance of these models however relies heavily on sufficient samples. The high cost of collecting ample data often results in a small training set, adversely impacting on the performance that these machine learning models can achieve. To overcome this problem, this paper for the first time proposes a new sector operation complexity evaluation framework based on knowledge transfer specifically for small-training-sample environment. The proposed framework is able to effectively mine knowledge hidden within the samples of the target sector, i.e. the sector undergoes evaluation, as well as other sectors, i.e. non-target sectors. Moreover, the framework can properly handle the integration between the knowledge derived from different sectors. Extensive experiments on real data of 6 sectors in China illustrate that our proposed framework can achieve promising performance on complexity evaluation when only a small training set of the target sector is available.}

abstract = {The development of trajectory-based operations and the rolling network operations plan in European air traffic management network implies a move towards more collaborative, strategic flight planning. This opens up the possibility for inclusion of additional information in the collaborative decision-making process. With that in mind, we define the indicator for the economic risk of network elements (e.g., sectors or airports) as the expected costs that the elements impose on airspace users due to Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations. The definition of the indicator is based on the analysis of historical ATFM regulations data, that provides an indication of the risk of accruing delay. This risk of delay is translated into a monetary risk for the airspace users, creating the new metric of the economic risk of a given airspace element. We then use some machine learning techniques to find the parameters leading to this economic risk. The metric is accompanied by an indication of the accuracy of the delay–cost prediction model. Lastly, the economic risk is transformed into a qualitative economic severity classification. The economic risks and consequently economic severity can be estimated for different temporal horizons and time periods providing an indicator which can be used by Air Navigation Service Providers to identify areas which might need the implementation of strategic measures (e.g., resectorisation or capacity provision change), and by Airspace Users to consider operation of routes which use specific airspace regions.}

abstract = {This study presents a hybrid spatiotemporal convolutional long short-term memory network with tri-directional temporal features (SCLN-TTF) for airway congestion index prediction. The spatial features, temporal features and spatiotemporal features are taken as input variables, among which the temporal and spatiotemporal input datasets are categorized into forward time series datasets, backward time series datasets and datasets at the target time. The spatial features are extracted using the fast-approximate convolutions on graphs, and the temporal features are extracted using the long short-term memory network. The subsequent congestion index is the output variable. The model parameters are sequentially updated based on the recent collected data and the new predicting results. It is found that, in general, the proposed SCLN-TTF method achieves the most stable and satisfactory performance for all the selected airways. The models exhibit the best performance for the 60 min prediction time horizon in terms of MAPE, while the proposed SCLN-TTF shows superiority compared to the other benchmark methods particularly for the 10 min prediction. Then the graph convolutional network and extreme gradient boosting method are combined for high congestion index identification. The finding further confirms the superiority of the proposed method by considering both the spatial and temporal dependencies and integrating forward and backward features.}

abstract = {Accurate and reliable forecasting of traffic variables is one of the primary functions of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Reliable systems that are able to forecast traffic conditions accurately, multiple time steps into the future, are required for advanced traveller information systems. However, traffic forecasting is a difficult task because of the nonlinear and nonstationary properties of traffic series. Traditional linear models are incapable of modelling such properties, and typically perform poorly, particularly when conditions differ from the norm. Machine learning approaches such as artificial neural networks, nonparametric regression and kernel methods (KMs) have often been shown to outperform linear models in the literature. A bottleneck of the latter approach is that the information pertaining to all previous traffic states must be contained within the kernel, but the computational complexity of KMs usually scales cubically with the number of data points in the kernel. In this paper, a novel kernel-based machine learning (ML) algorithm is developed, namely the local online kernel ridge regression (LOKRR) model. Exploiting the observation that traffic data exhibits strong cyclic patterns characterised by rush hour traffic, LOKRR makes use of local kernels with varying parameters that are defined around each time point. This approach has 3 advantages over the standard single kernel approach: (1) It allows parameters to vary by time of day, capturing the time varying distribution of traffic data; (2) It allows smaller kernels to be defined that contain only the relevant traffic patterns, and; (3) It is online, allowing new traffic data to be incorporated as it arrives. The model is applied to the forecasting of travel times on London’s road network, and is found to outperform three benchmark models in forecasting up to 1h ahead.}

Given a public event produces complicated spatiotemporal traffic impacts, existing data-driven approaches without involving traffic flow analysis show limited effectiveness to predict a public event. Motivated by this view, this study seeks to develop a domain-knowledge-based learning approach, which integrates shock wave analysis into deep learning models to predict the occurring of an upcoming public event (i.e., the SW-DLM approach). This integration raises new research challenging and calls for new approaches. Specifically, we develop an efficient algorithm to generate the shock wave diagrams to present the evolvement of the traffic anomaly, which expands whenever new traffic data is collected. Next, the shock wave diagram itself is not a well-coded input for feature extraction and learning. This study thus developed an innovative encoding approach, which transforms a shock wave diagram into an optimal pixel grid. Considering the features extracted from the encoded shock wave diagrams are fed into the long-short term memory (LSTM) model for the event prediction. The numerical experiments based on the field data indicate that the SW-DLM is able to predict a public event with 87% accuracy around 84 min before it starts in a day. It outperforms all data-driven machine learning models using point traffic data as inputs. Thus, we claim that using the shock wave diagrams can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the learning approaches for predicting a public event. The SW-DLM will help develop preventive traffic control or route plans to avoid traffic congestion induced by public events.}

A variety of methods to predict traffic variables in the short-term can be found in the literature, ranging from time-series algorithms, machine learning tools and deep learning methods to a selective hybrid of these approaches. Despite the advances in prediction techniques, a challenging problem that affects the application of such methods in the real world is the prevalence of insufficient data across an entire network. It is rare that extensive historical training data required for model training are available for all the links in a city. In order to address this data insufficiency problem, this paper applies transfer learning techniques to machine learning methods in short-term traffic prediction. All the traffic data used in this paper were collected from Highways England road networks in the UK. The results show that through improving the transferability of machine learning-based models, the computational burden due to the model training process can be significantly reduced and the prediction accuracy under data deficient scenarios can be improved for one-step ahead prediction. However, the prediction accuracy gradually decreases in multi-step ahead prediction. It is also found that the accuracy of the proposed hybrid method is highly dependent upon consistency between datasets but less dependent on geographical attributes of links.}

This paper presents a data analytics framework for high-fidelity characterization of air traffic flows from large-scale flight tracking data. Machine learning methods are used to exploit spatiotemporal patterns in aircraft movement towards the identification of trajectory patterns and traffic flow patterns. The outcomes and potential impacts of this framework are demonstrated with a comparative analysis of terminal area operations in three representative multi-airport (metroplex) systems of the global air transportation system: New York, Hong Kong and Sao Paulo. As a descriptive tool for systematic analysis of the flow behavior, the framework allows for cross-metroplex comparisons of terminal airspace design, utilization and traffic performance. Novel quantitative metrics are created to summarize metroplex efficiency, capacity and predictability. The results reveal several structural, operational and performance differences between the multi-airport systems analyzed. Our findings show that New York presents the most complex airspace design, with considerably higher number of routes and interactions between them, as well as more dynamic changes in the terminal area flow structure during the day, in part driven by the presence of flow dependencies. Interestingly, it exhibits the best levels of traffic flow efficiency on average, both spatially and temporally, yet the highest variability in metroplex configuration performance, with more pronounced performance degradation during inclement weather.}

In the train choice literature, discrete choice analysis is the predominant approach and many variants of logit models have been developed. Alternatively, emerging travel choice studies adopt non-utility-based methods, especially nonparametric machine learning methods including SVR and ANN, because (1) those methods do not rely on assumptions on the relations between choices and explanatory variables or any prior knowledge of the underlying relations; (2) they have superb capabilities of iteratively identifying patterns and extracting rules from data. This paper thus contributes to the HSR train choice literature by applying and comparing SVR and ANN with a real-world case study of the Shanghai-Beijing HSR market in China. A new normalized metric capturing both the load factor and the booking lead time is proposed as the target variable and several train service attributes, such as day of week, departure time, travel time, fare, are identified as input variables. Computational results demonstrate that both SVR and ANN can predict the train choice behavior with high accuracy, outperforming the linear regression approach. Potential applications of this study, such as rail pricing reform, have also been identified.}

abstract = {In the era of transportation big data, the analysis of mobility patterns generally involves large quantities of datasets with high-dimensional variables recording individual travelers’ activities and socio-economic attributes, bringing new challenges to researchers. Conventional regression-based models commonly require complex structures in depicting random or fixed effects with a considerable number of parameters to estimate, and state-of-the-art machine learning models are regarded as black-boxes that are not clear in interpreting the mechanism in human mobility. To overcome the challenges of capturing complex high-order relationships among variables of interest, this paper proposes a Bayesian supervised learning tensor factorization (BSTF) model for the classification of travel choices in the mobility pattern analysis. The BSTF model induces a hierarchical probabilistic structure between predictor variables and the dependent variable, which offers a nature supervised learning foundation via Bayesian inference. Latent class (LC) variables are considered in the BSTF model to discover hidden preferences/states among travelers associated with their mobility patterns. We apply the BSTF model to analyze passenger-side choice patterns between diverse service options on a ride-sourcing platform, drawing increasing attention during recent years. A case study with a real-world dynamic ridesharing dataset in Hangzhou, China, is conducted. Different cases of training sizes are utilized to fit the proposed BSTF model as well as some other state-of-the-art machine learning models. By identifying significant variables and derive their probabilistic relationship between service types (i.e., ridesharing, non-sharing, and taxi), the proposed BSTF model offers good performance in both classification accuracy and the interpretability of shared mobility.}

It lays the foundation for a number of advanced functions such as driver safety monitoring systems and adaptive driving assistance systems. In these applications, state recognition accuracy is of paramount importance to guarantee user acceptance. This paper is mainly focused on developing a personalized driving state recognition system by learning from non-intrusive, easily accessible vehicle related measurements and its validation using real-world driving data. Compared to conventional approaches, this paper first highlights the necessities of adopting a personalized system by analysing feature distribution of individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data via advanced data visualization and statistical analysis. If significant differences are identified, a dedicated personalized model is learnt to predict the driver’s driving state. Spearman distance is also drawn to evaluate the differences between individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data in a quantitative manner. In addition, five categories of classifiers are tested and compared to identify a suitable one for classification, where random forest with Bayesian parameter optimization outperforms others and therefore is adopted in this paper. A recently collected dataset from real-world driving experiments is adopted to evaluate the proposed system. Comparative experimental results indicate that the personalized learning system with road information significantly outperforms conventional approaches without considering personalized characteristics or road information, where the overall accuracy increases from 81.3% to 91.6%. It is believed that the newly developed personalized learning system can find a wide range of applications where diverse behaviours exist.}

The infrastructure managers have to come up with smart maintenance decisions in order to improve the assets’ condition, spend optimal cost and keep the network available. Currently, the infrastructure managers lack the tools and decision support models that could assist them in taking (un) planned maintenance decisions effectively and efficiently. Recently, many literature studies have proposed to employ the machine learning techniques to estimate the performance state of an asset, predict the maintenance need, possible failure modes, and such similar aspects in advance. Most of these studies have utilised additional data collection measures to record the assets’ behaviour. Though useful for experimentation, it is expensive and impractical to mount monitoring devices on multiple assets across the network. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop predictive models that utilise existing data from a railway agency and yield interpretable results. We propose to leverage the tree-based classification techniques of machine learning in order to predict maintenance need, activity type and trigger’s status of railway switches. Using the data from an in-use business process, predictive models based on the decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees are developed. Moreover, to facilitate in models interpretability, we provided a detail explanation of models’ predictions by features importance analysis and instance level details. Our solution approach of predictive models development and their results explanation have wider applicability and can be used for other asset types and different (maintenance) planning scenarios.}

By only observing the position information of the six vehicles surrounding the subject vehicle, the LSTM can extract the significant features that influence the CF and LC behaviors automatically and predict the vehicles behaviors with time-series data and memory effects. In addition, we propose a hybrid retraining constrained (HRC) training method to further optimize the LSTM model. With the I-80 trajectory data of NGSIM dataset we train and test the HRC LSTM model, while the results show that HRC LSTM model can accurately estimate CF and LC behaviors simultaneously with low longitudinal trajectories error and high LC prediction accuracy compared with the classical models. We also evaluate the transferability of the proposed model with the US101 dataset and a good transferability result is obtained as well.}

While a range of methods has been used in the past for driving style classification, the emergence of connected vehicles equipped with communication devices provides a new opportunity to classify driving style using high-resolution (10 Hz) microscopic real-world data. In this study, location-based big data and machine learning are used to classify driving styles ranging from aggressive to calm. This classification can be used to customize driver assistance systems, assess mobility, crash risk, fuel consumption, and emissions. This study’s main objective is to develop a framework that harnesses Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) generated by connected vehicles to quantify instantaneous driving behavior and classify driving styles in different spatial contexts using unsupervised machine learning methods. To this end, a subset of the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) with more than 27 million BSM observations generated by more than 1300 individuals making trips on diverse roadways and through several neighborhoods in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were processed and analyzed. To quantify driving style, the concept of temporal driving volatility, as a surrogate safety measure of unsafe driving behavior, was utilized and applied to vehicle kinematics, i.e., observed speeds and longitudinal/lateral accelerations. Specifically, six volatility measures are extracted and used for classifying drivers. K-means and K-medoids methods are applied for grouping drivers in aggressive, normal, and calm clusters. Clustering results indicate that not only does driving style vary among drivers, but the thresholds for aggressive and calm driving vary across different roadway types due to variations in environment and road conditions. The proportion of aggressive driving styles was also higher on commercial streets than on highways and residential streets. Notably, we propose a Driving Score to measure driving performance consistently across drivers.}

With the development of intelligent navigation and autonomous driving, it is necessary to explore the lane-level predictions of traffic speeds. However, most existing traffic prediction models concentrate on forecasting the traffic flow characteristics of the entire road sections rather than those of certain lanes. This paper proposes a fusion deep learning (FDL) model to predict lane-level traffic speed. First, the entropy-based grey relation analysis is introduced to choose lane sections that are strongly correlated with the lane section to be predicted. Second, a two-layer deep learning framework is established by combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network. Third, the ground-truth data of several lane sections captured by remote traffic microwave sensors (RTMS) on the 2nd Ring Road of Beijing are utilized to examine the FDL model and compare it with several benchmark models. The experimental result indicates that in addition to capturing the fluctuations of traffic speed at the lane level, the FDL model has better performance than the benchmark models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability.}

abstract = {Rapid measurements of large-scale pavement roughness have long been a hot topic in pavement condition evaluation and maintenance. Most traditional methods rely on dedicated devices, such as laser, Lidar and so on, which should be set up on customized vehicles. With the rapid development of sensing technology, vehicles owned by the general public are empowered with the ability to collect vibration measurements themselves. This crowdsourced dataset is convenient, extensive coverage, inexpensive, and has high sampling frequency, making it a suitable source for large-scale pavement roughness evaluation. However, vehicle information is missing for these data due to privacy protection, which renders them quite difficult to directly use with traditional model-based methods. Thus, in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) model to deal with the problem of incomplete data and multi-vehicle data fusion. A mathematical derivation of the ‘international roughness index’ (IRI) using in-car vibrations is established. Furthermore, given the multi-vehicle scenario, a self-training model is designed to iteratively estimate IRIs in a roadway network. Both the confidences of the vehicle parameters and IRI estimation are considered in the algorithm to improve its reliability and robustness. A full-car simulation model is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the overall relative error is less than 10% for 50 road sections in the network, which is a significant improvement compared to traditional multi-vehicle average models. The errors of the SSL model are found to be significantly dependent on the iteration order. Based on the proposed model, the coupled impact of the sampling rate and vehicle quantity on the model’s accuracy is further discussed. The proposed approach provides new insights into large-scale pavement roughness measurements.}

abstract = {As app-based ride-hailing services have been widely adopted within existing traditional taxi markets, researchers have been devoted to understand the important factors that influence the demand of the new mobility. Econometric models (EMs) are mainly utilized to interpret the significant factors of the demand, and deep neural networks (DNNs) have been recently used to improve the forecasting performance by capturing complex patterns in the large datasets. However, to mitigate possible (induced) traffic congestion and balance utilization rates for the current taxi drivers, an effective strategy of proactively managing a quota system for both emerging services and regular taxis is still critically needed. This paper aims to systematically design an explainable deep learning model capable of assessing the quota system balancing the demand volumes between two modes. A two-stage interpretable machine learning modeling framework was developed by a linear regression (LR) model, coupled with a neural network layered by long short-term memory (LSTM). The first stage investigates the correlation between the existing taxis and on-demand ride-hailing services while controlling for other explanatory variables. The second stage fulfills the long short-term memory (LSTM) network structure, capturing the residuals from the first estimation stage in order to enhance the forecasting performance. The proposed stepwise modeling approach (LR-LSTM) forecasts the demand of taxi rides, and it is implemented in the application of pick-up demand prediction using New York City (NYC) taxi data. The experiment result indicates that the integrated model can capture the inter-relationships between existing taxis and ride-hailing services as well as identify the influence of additional factors, namely, the day of the week, weather, and holidays. Overall, this modeling approach can be applied to construct an effective active demand management (ADM) for the short-term period as well as a quota control strategy between on-demand ride-hailing services and traditional taxis.}

The new trajectory-based Concept of Operations is supported by performance-based trajectory predictors as major enablers. Currently, the performance of ground-based trajectory predictors is affected by diverse factors such as weather, lack of integration of operational information or aircraft performance uncertainty. Trajectory predictors could be enhanced by learning from historical data. Nowadays, data from the Air Traffic Management system may be exploited to understand to what extent Air Traffic Control actions impact on the vertical profile of flight trajectories. This paper analyses the impact of diverse operational factors on the vertical profile of flight trajectories. Firstly, Multilevel Linear Models are adopted to conduct a prior identification of these factors. Then, the information is exploited by trajectory predictors, where two types are used: point-mass trajectory predictors enhanced by learning the thrust law depending on those factors; and trajectory predictors based on Artificial Neural Networks. Air Traffic Control vertical operational procedures do not constitute a main factor impacting on the vertical profile of flight trajectories, once the top of descent is established. Additionally, airspace flows and the flight level at the trajectory top of descent are relevant features to be considered when learning from historical data, enhancing the overall performance of the trajectory predictors for the descent phase.}

The paper presents a new modeling framework that is able to simulate temporal information associated with the traveler’s daily activity schedule, for use in activity-based travel demand modeling. We employed a precise and efficient machine learning technique known as Random-Forest for temporal attribute recognition. In order to capture the uncertainty of start time and activity duration, initially we derived unique clusters of homogeneous daily activity patterns from the activity data. The Random-Forest model is formulated based on the socio-demographic characteristics of travelers and temporal features of their activities. Start time and activity duration for every activity type were allocated to a set of bins. In this study, eight different bin structures, varying in the time interval, are designed as response variables. Using a heuristic decision rule-based algorithm, the predicted activities were inserted into the traveler’s skeleton schedule. An algorithm was then applied to schedule travelers’ activities based on activity importance level and guide information gained from representative patterns for homogeneous population cohorts. The model was tested using time-diary data drawn from the Space-Time Activity Research (STAR) survey for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Results show that the proposed model is able to assemble the traveler’s schedule with an average 81.62% accuracy in the 24-hour period. The insights gained from this study include important temporal information on activities crucial for the scheduling stage of an activity-based model. Finally, the results of this paper are expected to be implemented within the activity-based travel demand model, Scheduler for Activities, Locations, and Travel (SALT).}

Researchers and policymakers envision that AV deployment will change transportation, development patterns, and other urban systems. Researchers have examined AVs and their potential impacts with two methods: (1) survey-based studies of AV preferences and (2) simulation-based estimation of secondary impacts of varied AV deployment strategies, such as Shared AVs (SAVs) and Privately-owned AVs (PAVs). While the preference survey literature can inform AV simulation studies, preference study results have so far not been integrated into simulation-based research. This lack of integration stems from the absence of data that measure preferences towards PAVs and SAVs at the neighborhood level. Existing preference studies usually investigate adoption likelihood without collecting appropriate information to link preferences to precise locations or neighborhoods. This study develops a microsimulation approach, incorporating machine learning and population synthesizing, to fill this data gap, leveraging a national AV perception survey (NAVPS) and the latest National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data. The model is applied to San Francisco, CA, and Austin, TX, to test the concept. We validate the proposed model by comparing the spatial distributions of synthesized ride-hailing users and observed ride-hailing trips. High correlations between our synthesized user density and empirical trip distributions in two study areas, to some extent, verify our proposed modeling approach.}

Although their apparent use has mostly been limited to image recognition and classification in recent years, generative machine learning algorithms can be a powerful tool for travel behaviour research by replicating travel behaviour by the underlying properties of data structures. In this paper, we examine the use of generative machine learning approach for analyzing multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) travel behaviour data. We provide a plausible perspective of how we can exploit the use of machine learning techniques to interpret the underlying heterogeneities in the data. We show that generative models are conceptually similar to the choice selection behaviour process through information entropy and variational Bayesian inference. Without loss of generality, we consider a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) based algorithm with multiple discrete-continuous layers, formulated as a variational Bayesian inference optimization problem. We systematically describe the proposed machine learning algorithm and develop a process of analyzing travel behaviour data from a generative learning perspective. We show parameter stability from model analysis and simulation tests on an open dataset with multiple discrete-continuous dimensions from a data size of 293,330 observations. For interpretability, we derive the conditional probabilities, elasticities and perform statistical analysis on the latent variables. We show that our model can generate statistically similar data distributions for travel forecasting and prediction and performs better than purely discriminative methods in validation. Our results indicate that latent constructs in generative models can accurately represent the joint distribution consistently on MDC data.}

Uncertainties in the airborne phase have significantly less impact on flight punctuality than deviations in aircraft ground operations. The ground trajectory of an aircraft primarily consists of the handling processes at the stand, defined as the aircraft turnaround, which are mainly controlled by operational experts. Only the aircraft boarding, which is on the critical path of the turnaround, is driven by the passengers’ experience and willingness or ability to follow the proposed procedures. We used a recurrent neural network approach to predict the progress of a running boarding event. In particular, we implemented and trained the Long Short-Term Memory model. Since no operational data of the specific passenger behavior is available, we used a reliable, validated boarding simulation environment to provide data about the aircraft boarding events. First predictions show that uni-variate input (seat load progress) produces insufficient results, so we consider expected passenger interactions in the aircraft cabin as well. These interactions are aggregated to a prior-developed complexity metric and allow an efficient evaluation of the current boarding progress. With this multi-variate input, our Long Short-Term Memory model achieves appropriate prediction results for the boarding progress.}

While existing DNN models can provide better performance than shallow models, it is still an open issue of making full use of spatial-temporal characteristics of the traffic flow to improve their performance. In addition, our understanding of them on traffic data remains limited. This paper proposes a DNN based traffic flow prediction model (DNN-BTF) to improve the prediction accuracy. The DNN-BTF model makes full use of weekly/daily periodicity and spatial-temporal characteristics of traffic flow. Inspired by recent work in machine learning, an attention based model was introduced that automatically learns to determine the importance of past traffic flow. The convolutional neural network was also used to mine the spatial features and the recurrent neural network to mine the temporal features of traffic flow. We also showed through visualization how DNN-BTF model understands traffic flow data and presents a challenge to conventional thinking about neural networks in the transportation field that neural networks is purely a “black-box” model. Data from open-access database PeMS was used to validate the proposed DNN-BTF model on a long-term horizon prediction task. Experimental results demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.}

This paper demonstrates that DNNs can provide economic information as complete as classical discrete choice models (DCMs). The economic information from DNNs includes choice predictions, choice probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns of alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities, marginal rates of substitution, and heterogeneous values of time. Unlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn utility functions and reveal behavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts, particularly when the sample size is large. However, the economic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable when the sample size is small, because of three challenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. The first challenge is related to the statistical challenge of balancing approximation and estimation errors of DNNs, the second to the optimization challenge of identifying the global optimum in the DNN training, and the third to the robustness challenge of mitigating locally irregular patterns of estimated functions. To demonstrate the strength and challenges, we estimated the DNNs using a stated preference survey from Singapore and a revealed preference data from London, extracted the full list of economic information from the DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the economic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more reliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or trainings, and that larger sample size, hyperparameter searching, model ensemble, and effective regularization can significantly improve the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs. Future studies should investigate the requirement of sample size, better ensemble mechanisms, other regularizations and DNN architectures, better optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address DNNs three challenges to provide more reliable economic information for DNN-based choice models.}

abstract = {In peak hours, when the limited transportation capacity of urban rail transit is not adequate enough to meet the travel demands, the density of the passengers waiting at the platform can exceed the critical density of the platform. Coordinated passenger inflow control strategy is required to adjust/meter the inflow volume and relieve some of the demand pressure at crowded metro stations so as to ensure both operational efficiency and safety at such stations for all passengers. However, such strategy is usually developed by the operation staff at each station based on their practical working experience. As such, the best strategy/decision cannot always be made and sometimes can even be highly undesirable due to their inability to account for the dynamic performance of all metro stations in the entire rail transit network. In this paper, a new reinforcement learning-based method is developed to optimize the inflow volume during a certain period of time at each station with the aim of minimizing the safety risks imposed on passengers at the metro stations. Basic principles and fundamental components of the reinforcement learning, as well as the reinforcement learning-based problem-specific algorithm are presented. The simulation experiment carried out on a real-world metro line in Shanghai is constructed to test the performance of the approach. Simulation results show that the reinforcement learning-based inflow volume control strategy is highly effective in minimizing the safety risks by reducing the frequency of passengers being stranded. Additionally, the strategy also helps to relieve the passenger congestion at certain stations.}

While this type of mobility data adds significant value to various analyses, one challenge that persists is lack of information about the types of vehicles that performed the recorded trips, which clearly limits the value of trajectory data in transportation system analysis. To overcome this limitation of trajectory data, a deep Convolutional Neural Network for Vehicle Classification (CNN-VC) is proposed to identify the vehicle’s class from its trajectory. This paper proposes a novel representation of GPS trajectories, which is not only compatible with deep learning models, but also captures both vehicle-motion characteristics and roadway features. To this end, an open source navigation system is also exploited to obtain more accurate information on travel time and distance between GPS coordinates. Before delving into training the CNN-VC model, an efficient programmatic strategy is also designed to label large-scale GPS trajectories by means of vehicle information obtained through Virtual Weigh Station records. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed CNN-VC model consistently outperforms both classical machine learning algorithms and other deep learning baseline methods. From a practical perspective, the CNN-VC model allows us to label raw GPS trajectories with vehicle classes, thereby enriching the data and enabling more comprehensive transportation studies such as derivation of vehicle class-specific origin-destination tables that can be used for planning.}

It can be divided in two parts, a digraph-based representation for hybrid urban traffic network and a Dirgraph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCN)-based learning model. At first, the representation incorporates the fundamental traffic variables with the correlation of different traffic flows, and partially decouples the global network topology from local traffic information. And then, to proceed with digraph-based samples, a new type of graph feature extraction method is introduced and the graph Fourier transform is defined accordingly. This distinguishes the proposed model from the conventional graph convolutional networks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted based on real traffic data. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework over the existing congestion recognition methods.}

The proposed model consists of two parts: clustering-based preprocessing and Multi-Cells Neural Network (MCNN)-based prediction. Firstly, in the preprocessing part, after data cleaning, filtering and data re-sampling, we applied principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of trajectory vector variable. Then, the trajectories are clustered into several patterns by clustering algorithm. Using nested cross validation, MCNN model is trained to find out the appropriate prediction model of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each individual cluster cell. Finally, the predicted ETA for each new flight is generated in different cluster cells classified by decision trees. To assess the performance of MCNN model, the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is proposed as the comparison learning model, and K-means++ and DBSCAN are proposed as two comparison clustering models in preprocessing part. With real 4D trajectory data in Beijing TMA, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model MCNN with DBSCAN in preprocessing is the most effective and robust hybrid machine learning model, both in trajectory clustering and short-term 4D trajectory prediction.

In contrast to other machine learning methods that have been treated as black-boxes, tree based ensemble methods provide interpretable results, while requiring little data preprocessing, are able to handle different types of predictor variables, and can fit complex nonlinear relationship. These properties make the tree based ensemble methods good candidates for solving travel time prediction problems. However, applications of tree-based ensemble algorithms in traffic prediction area are limited. In this paper, we employ a gradient boosting regression tree method (GBM) to analyze and model freeway travel time to improve the prediction accuracy and model interpretability. The gradient boosting tree method strategically combines additional trees by correcting mistakes made by its previous base models, therefore, potentially improves prediction accuracy. Different parameters’ effect on model performance and correlations of input–output variables are discussed in details by using travel time data provided by INRIX along two freeway sections in Maryland. The proposed method is, then, compared with another popular ensemble method and a bench mark model.

In addition, to capture more knowledge from the geometry data, some additional features, including Track Quality Index (TQI), energy spectral density, and time-trend are extracted. This, in turn, facilitates the learning and predicting process. Moreover, since there exists a very limited number of rail defects, the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN) is applied to overcome the issue of imbalance in the dataset.

abstract = {Air Traffic Management is evolving towards a Trajectory-Based Operations paradigm. Trajectory prediction will hold a key role supporting its deployment, but it is limited by a lack of understanding of air traffic associated uncertainties, specifically contextual factors. Trajectory predictors are usually based on modelling aircraft dynamics based on intrinsic aircraft features. These aircraft operate within a known air route structure and under given meteorological conditions. However, actual aircraft trajectories are modified by the air traffic control depending on potential conflicts with other traffics. This paper introduces surrounding air traffic as a feature for ground-based trajectory prediction. The introduction of air traffic as a contextual factor is addressed by identifying aircraft which are likely to lose the horizontal separation. For doing so, this paper develops a probabilistic horizontal interdependency measure between aircraft supported by machine learning algorithms, addressing time separations at crossing points. Then, vertical profiles of flight trajectories are characterised depending on this factor and other intrinsic features. The paper has focused on the descent phase of the trajectories, using datasets corresponding to an en-route Spanish airspace volume. The proposed interdependency measure demonstrates to identify in advance conflicting situations between pairs of aircraft for this use case. This is validated by identifying associated air traffic control actions upon them and their impact on the vertical profile of the trajectories. Finally, a trajectory predictor for the vertical profile of the trajectory is developed, considering the interdependency measure and other operational factors. The paper concludes that the air traffic can be included as a factor for the trajectory prediction, impacting on the location of the top of descent for the specific case which has been studied.}

abstract = {Rail network velocity is defined as system-wide average speed of line-haul movement between terminals. To accommodate increased service demand and load on rail networks, increase in network velocity, without compromising safety, is required. Among many determinants of overall network velocity, a key driver is service interruption, including lowered operating speed due to track/train condition and delays caused by derailments. Railroads have put significant infrastructure and inspection programs in place to avoid service interruptions. One of the key measures is an extensive network of wayside mechanical condition detectors (temperature, strain, vision, infrared, weight, impact, etc.) that monitor the rolling-stock as it passes by. The detectors are designed to alert for conditions that either violate regulations set by governmental rail safety agencies or deteriorating rolling-stock conditions as determined by the railroad. Using huge volumes of historical detector data, in combination with failure data, maintenance action data, inspection schedule data, train type data and weather data, we are exploring several analytical approaches including, correlation analysis, causal analysis, time series analysis and machine learning techniques to automatically learn rules and build failure prediction models. These models will be applied against both historical and real-time data to predict conditions leading to failure in the future, thus avoiding service interruptions and increasing network velocity. Additionally, the analytics and models can also be used for detecting root cause of several failure modes and wear rate of components, which, while do not directly address network velocity, can be proactively used by maintenance organizations to optimize trade-offs related to maintenance schedule, costs and shop capacity. As part of our effort, we explore several avenues to machine learning techniques including distributed learning and hierarchical analytical approaches.}

In this work, we have demonstrated that the developed machine learning algorithm as an inverse problem solver can accurately identify initial collision conditions in an inverse manner, which are practically unique if we use permanent plastic deformation as the forensic data signatures. In other words, we think that the massive plastic energy dissipation process and the related big data will make final structure damage state insensitive to the initial car collision conditions. Thus, it provides an inverse solution for car crash forensic analysis by reconstructing the initial failure load parameters and conditions based on the permanent plastic deformation distribution of cars. This approach has general significance in solving the inverse problem for engineering failure analysis and vehicle crashworthiness analysis, which provides a key contribution for the unmanned autonomous vehicle and the related technology.}

While many studies accomplished traffic forecasting task with deep learning models, there is still an open issue of exploiting spatial-temporal traffic state features for better prediction performance, and the model interpretability has not been taken serious. In this study, we propose a path based deep learning framework which can produce better traffic speed prediction at a city wide scale, furthermore, the model is both rational and interpretable in the context of urban transportation. Specifically, we divide the road network into critical paths, which is helpful to mine the traffic flow mechanism. Then, each critical path is modeled through the bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (Bi-LSTM NN), and multiple Bi-LSTM layers are stacked to incorporate temporal information. At the stage of traffic prediction, the spatial-temporal features captured from these processes are fed into a fully-connected layer. Finally, results for each path are ensembled for network-wise traffic speed prediction. In the empirical studies, we compare the proposed model with multiple benchmark methods. Under a series of prediction scenarios (i.e., different input and prediction horizons), the superior performance of the proposed framework is validated. Moreover, by analyzing feature from hidden-layer output, the study explains the physical meaning of the hidden feature and illustrate model’s interpretability.}

It forecasts a congestion score, defined as the ratio of the vehicle accumulation inside a neighborhood to its trip completion rate. Inputs include congestion scores measured at earlier times in neighborhoods within a region, and three other real-time measures of regional traffic. The ideas are tested using Newell’s simplified theory of kinematic waves. Simplified street networks are featured first. Initial tests demonstrate the suitability of the congestion score for characterizing neighborhood traffic conditions, and that the score can be predicted using the four inputs. Further tests of the simplified networks illustrate the value of the deep learning approach, as compared against the use of three benchmark models. A next round of tests shows that the model can be made robust, even to adverse settings. A final round of tests features a pared-down version of the freeway network in the San Francisco Bay Area. The final tests show that the model is scalable. The model is thereafter improved by representing the inputs through weighted undirected graphs that incorporate the route-choice of individuals, and learning features through graph convolutions. A framework for better interpreting the contributions of the model’s inputs to its output is developed. A demonstration of the model’s usefulness in designing traffic control schemes is presented as well.}

abstract = {Ground-based aircraft trajectory prediction is a major concern in air traffic control and management. A safe and efficient prediction is a prerequisite to the implementation of new automated tools. In current operations, trajectory prediction is computed using a physical model. It models the forces acting on the aircraft to predict the successive points of the future trajectory. Using such a model requires knowledge of the aircraft state (mass) and aircraft intent (thrust law, speed intent). Most of this information is not available to ground-based systems. This paper focuses on the climb phase. We improve the trajectory prediction accuracy by predicting some of the unknown point-mass model parameters. These unknown parameters are the mass and the speed intent. This study relies on ADS-B data coming from The OpenSky Network. It contains the climbing segments of the year 2017 detected by this sensor network. The 11 most frequent aircraft types are studied. The obtained data set contains millions of climbing segments from all over the world. The climbing segments are not filtered according to their altitude. Predictive models returning the missing parameters are learned from this data set, using a Machine Learning method. The trained models are tested on the two last months of the year and compared with a baseline method (BADA used with the mean parameters computed on the first ten months). Compared with this baseline, the Machine Learning approach reduce the RMSE on the altitude by 48% on average on a 10 min horizon prediction. The RMSE on the speed is reduced by 25% on average. The trajectory prediction is also improved for small climbing segments. Using only information available before the considered aircraft take-off, the Machine Learning method can predict the unknown parameters, reducing the RMSE on the altitude by 25% on average. The data set and the Machine Learning code are publicly available.}

abstract = {In last mile distribution, logistics companies typically arrange and plan their routes based on broad estimates of stop delivery times (i.e., the time spent at each stop to deliver goods to final receivers). If these estimates are not accurate, the level of service is degraded, as the promised time window may not be satisfied. The purpose of this work is to assess the feasibility of machine learning techniques to predict stop delivery times. This is done by testing a wide range of machine learning techniques (including different types of ensembles) to (1) predict the stop delivery time and (2) to determine whether the total stop delivery time will exceed a predefined time threshold (classification approach). For the assessment, all models are trained using information generated from GPS data collected in Medellín, Colombia and compared to hazard duration models. The results are threefold. First, the assessment shows that regression-based machine learning approaches are not better than conventional hazard duration models concerning absolute errors of the prediction of the stop delivery times. Second, when the problem is addressed by a classification scheme in which the prediction is aimed to guide whether a stop time will exceed a predefined time, a basic K-nearest-neighbor model outperforms hazard duration models and other machine learning techniques both in accuracy and F1 score (harmonic mean between precision and recall). Third, the prediction of the exact duration can be improved by combining the classifiers and prediction models or hazard duration models in a two level scheme (first classification then prediction). However, the improvement depends largely on the correct classification (first level).}

Many features impact on taxi time, including the route taken, aircraft category, operational mode of the airport, traffic congestion information, and local weather conditions. Working with real-world data for several international airports, we compare multiple prediction models and investigate the impact of these features, drawing conclusions on the most important features for accurately modelling taxi times. We show that high accuracy can be achieved with a small subset of the features consisting of those generally important across all airports (departure/arrival, distance, total turns, average speed and numbers of recent aircraft), and a small number of features specific to particular target airports. Moving from all features to this small subset results in less than a 1 percentage-point drop in movements correctly predicted within 1, 3 and 5 min.}

In this article, we introduce a new Cooperative Group-Based Multi-Agent reinforcement learning-ATSC (CGB-MATSC) framework. It is based on Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System (CVIS) to realize effective control in the large-scale road network. We propose a CGB-MAQL algorithm that applies k-nearest-neighbor-based state representation, pheromone-based regional green-wave control mode, and spatial discounted reward to stabilize the learning convergence. Extensive experiments and ablation studies of the CGB-MAQL algorithm show its effectiveness and scalability in the synthetic road network, Monaco city and Harbin city scenarios.

Data collected from on-board recorders in commercial aircraft contain thousands of parameters in the form of multivariate time-series (continuous, discrete, categorical, etc.) which are used to train the machine learning models. Among the phases of flight, approach and landing phases result in the most accidents and incidents. The performance and trajectory of the aircraft during the approach phase is an indicator of its landing performance which, in turn, affects incident or accident probability such as runway excursions. Landing performance is commonly measured using metrics such as landing airspeed, vertical speed, location of touchdown point on runway, etc. While current applications of machine learning to aviation focus on retrospective insights to implement corrective measures, they offer limited value for real-time risk identification or decision-making as they are inherently reactive in nature. In this work, a novel offline-online framework is developed for building a global predictive model offline to predict landing performance metrics online. The framework leverages flight data from the approach phase between certain approach altitudes (also called gates) in order to train the offline model to predict the landing true airspeed and ground speed using a Random Forest regression algorithm. Permutation importance is used to identify and retain important features among those available and the training data is balanced with respect to flight safety events to ensure a good performing model. The developed global model is robust and can predict landing true airspeed and ground speed with root mean square errors of 2.62 and 2.98 knots respectively over six different airframes operating at over seventy airports. The model operates fast in prediction mode which, coupled with the ability to provide the prediction at an altitude where a go-around decision may be made, makes it particularly suitable for online application. The framework is demonstrated using data obtained from commercial airline operations that contains thousands of flight records and performs better than existing techniques in literature at predicting true airspeed and ground speed at touchdown.}

TQI is expressed in terms of track parameters like gage, cross-level, etc. Though each of these parameters is objectively important but understanding what they collectively convey for a given track segment often becomes challenging. Several railways including passenger and freight have developed single indices that combines different track parameters to assess overall track quality. Some of these railways have selected certain parameters whilst dropping others. Using track geometry data from a sample mile track, we demonstrate how to combine track geometry parameters into a low dimensional form (TQI) that simplifies the track properties without losing much variability in the data. This led us to principal components. To validate the use of principal components as TQI, we employed a two-phase approach. First phase was to identify a classic machine learning technique that works well with track geometry data. The second step was to train the identified machine learning technique on the sample mile-track data using combined TQIs and principal components as defect predictors. The performance of the predictors were compared using true and false positive rates. The results show that three principal components were better at predicting defects and revealing salient characteristics in track geometry data than combined TQIs even though there were some correlations that are potentially useful for track maintenance.}

This study attempts to bridge the research gap by predicting signal cycle-level through and left-turn movements in real-time at signalized intersections. The utilized data were limited to the upstream and downstream intersections at the corridor level. Aiming to achieve this objective, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models were developed using datsets that contain variables from different number of utilized cycles (4, 6, and 8 cycles). The three models were evaluated by calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results showed that the performance measures for the three models were close. Meanwhile. the GRU model using variables from six previous cycles outperformed the others. This modelling approach was followed to predict traffic movements for different time horizons (five cycles ahead). The performance measures values were close for the five predicted cycles. It is expected that the model could help in obtaining accurate traffic movement at intersections, which could be used for adjusting adaptive signal timing and improve signal and intersections’ efficiency.}

With the gradual and rapid adoption of GPS-enabled smart devices in modern society, this task greatly benefits from the massive volume of GPS trajectories generated. However, existing identification approaches heavily rely on manual annotation of these trajectories with their accurate travel mode information, which is both economically inefficient and error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep ensemble learning approach for travel mode identification to use a minimal number of annotated data for the task. The proposed approach accepts GPS trajectories of arbitrary lengths and extracts their latent information with a tailor-made feature engineering process. We devise a new deep neural network architecture to establish the mapping from this latent information domain to the final travel mode domain. An ensemble is accordingly constructed to develop proxy labels for unannotated data based on the rare annotated ones so that both types of data contribute to the learning process. Comprehensive case studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed approach, which notably outperforms existing ones with partially-labeled training data. Furthermore, we investigate its robustness to noisy data and the effectiveness of its constituting components.}

Recently, DNN models such as the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have shown remarkable success in modelling complex and noisy behavioural data. However, econometric studies have argued that machine learning techniques are a ‘black-box’ and difficult to interpret for use in the choice analysis. We develop a data-driven choice model that extends the systematic utility function to incorporate non-linear cross-effects using a series of residual layers and using skipped connections to handle model identifiability in estimating a large number of parameters. The model structure accounts for cross-effects and choice heterogeneity arising from substitution, interactions with non-chosen alternatives and other effects in a non-linear manner. We describe the formulation, model estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance and econometric implications of our proposed model. We present an illustrative example of the model on a classic red/blue bus choice scenario example. For a real-world application, we use a travel mode choice dataset to analyze the model characteristics compared to traditional neural networks and Logit formulations. Our findings show that our ResLogit approach significantly outperforms MLP models while providing similar interpretability as a Multinomial Logit model.}

abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of estimating historical traffic volumes between sparsely-located traffic sensors, which transportation agencies need to accurately compute statewide performance measures. To this end, the paper examines applications of vehicle probe data, automatic traffic recorder counts, and neural network models to estimate hourly volumes in the Maryland highway network, and proposes a novel approach that combines neural networks with an existing profiling method. On average, the proposed approach yields 24% more accurate estimates than volume profiles, which are currently used by transportation agencies across the US to compute statewide performance measures. The paper also quantifies the value of using vehicle probe data in estimating hourly traffic volumes, which provides important managerial insights to transportation agencies interested in acquiring this type of data. For example, results show that volumes can be estimated with a mean absolute percent error of about 21% at locations where average number of observed probes is between 30 and 47 vehicles/h, which provides a useful guideline for assessing the value of probe vehicle data from different vendors.}

It is the first-of-its-kind survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both transportation engineering and AI for mixed traffic modeling. We will discuss state-of-the-art applications of AI-guided methods, identify opportunities and obstacles, and raise open questions. We divide the stage of AV deployment into four phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AV-dominated, and the pure AVs. This paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. Models used for each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep (reinforcement) learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we primarily focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving policies are to control a large number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate human driver behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled in the environment? (4) How are the interactions between human drivers and autonomous vehicles characterized? We also provide a list of public datasets and simulation software related to AVs. Hopefully this paper will not only inspire our transportation community to rethink the conventional models that are developed in the data-shortage era, but also start conversations with other disciplines, in particular robotics and machine learning, to join forces towards creating a safe and efficient mixed traffic ecosystem.}

The former aims to estimate traffic flow on a single link with both filtered CL data, extracted spatio-temporal traffic features, and LPR data by incorporating the unique merits thereof.

In this study, we develop an innovative data-driven approach for devising efficient vehicle relocation policy for OMS that (1) proactively relocates vehicles before the demand is observed and (2) reduces the inequality among drivers’ income so that the proactive relocation policy is fair and is likely to be followed by drivers. Our approach represents the fusion of optimization and machine learning methods, which comprises three steps: First, we formulate the optimal proactive relocation as an optimal/stable matching problems and solve for global optimal solutions based on historical data. Second, the optimal solutions are then grouped and fed to train the deep learning models which consist of fully connected layers and long short-term memory networks. Low rank approximation is introduced to reduce the model complexity and improve the training performances. Finally, we use the trained model to predict the relocation policy which can be implemented in real time. We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the performances of the proposed method using New York City taxi data. The results suggest that our method will reduce empty mileage per trip by 54–70% under the optimal matching strategy, and a 25–32% reduction can also be achieved by following the stable matching strategy. We also validate that the predicted relocation policies are robust in the presence of uncertain passenger demand level and passenger trip-requesting behavior.}

abstract = {Ridesourcing services provide alternative mobility options in several cities. Their market share has grown exponentially due to the convenience they provide. The use of such services may be associated with car-light or car-free lifestyles. However, there are growing concerns regarding their impact on urban transportation operations performance due to empty, unproductive miles driven without a passenger (commonly referred to as deadheading). This paper is motivated by the potential to reduce deadhead mileage of ridesourcing trips by providing drivers with information on future ridesourcing trip demand. Future demand information enables the driver to wait in place for the next rider’s request without cruising around and contributing to congestion. A machine learning model is employed to predict hourly and 10-minute future interval travel demand for ridesourcing at a given location. Using future demand information, we propose algorithms to (i) assign drivers to act on received demand information by waiting in place for the next rider, and (ii) match these drivers with riders to minimize deadheading distance. Real-world data from ridesourcing providers in Austin, TX (RideAustin) and Chengdu, China (DiDi Chuxing) are leveraged. Results show that this process achieves 68%–82% and 53%–60% reduction of trip-level deadheading miles for the RideAustin and DiDi Chuxing sample operations respectively, under the assumption of unconstrained availability of short-term parking. Deadheading savings increase slightly as the maximum tolerable waiting time for the driver increases. Further, it is observed that significant deadhead savings per trip are possible, even when a small percent of the ridesourcing driver pool is provided with future ridesourcing demand information.}

Such stop-scale approaches ignore the fact that delays are also caused and perpetuated by network-wide factors (e.g., bottlenecks caused by shared tracks by multiple transit lines). The objective of this paper is to develop a network model and metrics that can quantify the delay dependencies between transit network stops, and identify local sources of network-wide issues. For this purpose, Bayesian network learning (at the intersection of machine learning and network science) was utilized. Based on the calculated Bayesian networks (BNs), network metrics (inducer and susceptible) were formulated to quantify the network-wide impacts of the delays experienced at the stops. To implement the proposed framework, the delays at Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) were gathered through a crowdsourced real-time transit information app called onTime. The developed BN model was tested through cross-validation, yielded promising accuracy results, successfully identified the problematic stops based on LIRR reports, and provided further insights on network impacts. The BN model and the developed metrics were further tested using a natural experiment, i.e., a before and after study focusing on a recently completed track expansion project at LIRR. The findings imply that BN learning can successfully identify the network dependencies and indicate the rail links/corridors that are the best candidate for subsequent improvement investments. Overall, the developed metrics can quantify the delay dependencies between stops and they can be used by policy makers and practitioners for investment and improvement decisions.}

The application of this methodology will produce results that enable historical analysis of the use of initiatives and evaluation of the relative success of different courses of action. Several challenges are overcome here including the need to identify the appropriate machine learning algorithms to apply, to quantify the differences between calendar days, to select features describing days, to obtain appropriate raw data, and to evaluate results in a meaningful way. These challenges are overcome via a review of relevant literature, the identification and trial of several useful models and data sets, and careful application of methods. For example, the cluster analysis that ultimately selects sets of similar days uses a distance metric based on variable importance measures from a separate classification model of observed initiatives. The methodology defined here is applied to the New York area, although it could be applied by other researchers to other areas.}

In this study, we developed a reinforcement learning-based approach for modeling and simulation of people mass movement using the global positioning system (GPS) data. Unlike traditional travel demand modeling approaches, our method focuses on the problem of inferring the spatio-temporal preferences of individuals from the observed trajectories, and is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques. We applied the model to the data collected from a smartphone application and attempted to replicate a large amount of the population’s daily movement by incorporating with agent-based multi-modal traffic simulation technologies. The simulation results indicate that agents can successfully learn and generate human-like travel activities. Furthermore, the proposed model performance significantly outperforms the existing methods in synthetic urban dynamics.}

abstract = {Bus bunching has been a long-standing problem that undermines the efficiency and reliability of public transport services. The most popular countermeasure in practice is to introduce static and dynamic holding control. However, most previous holding control strategies mainly consider local information with a pre-specified headway/schedule, while the global coordination of the whole bus fleet and its long-term effect are often overlooked. To efficiently incorporate global coordination and long-term operation in bus holding, in this paper we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) framework to develop dynamic and flexible holding control strategies for a bus route. Specifically, we model each bus as an agent that interacts with not only its leader/follower but also all other vehicles in the fleet. To better explore potential strategies, we develop an effective headway-based reward function in the proposed framework. In the learning framework, we model fleet coordination by using a basic actor-critic scheme along with a joint action tracker to better characterize the complex interactions among agents in policy learning, and we apply proximal policy optimization to improve learning performance. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the proposed MDRL framework against multiple baseline models that only rely on local information. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework and show the promise of applying MDRL in the coordinative control of public transport vehicle fleets in real-world operations.}

CADSE system includes three subsystems to calibrate smartphone, to classify the maneuvers, and to evaluate driving styles. For each maneuver, the smartphone sensors data are gathered in three successive time intervals referred as pre-maneuver, in-maneuver, and post-maneuver times. Then, we extract some important mathematical and experimental features from these data. Afterwards, we propose an ensemble learning method on these features to classify the maneuvers. This ensemble method includes decision tree, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors. Finally, we develop a rule-based fuzzy inference system to integrate the outputs of these algorithms and to recognize dangerous and safe maneuvers. CADSE saves this result in driver’s profile to consider more for dangerous driving recognition. The experimental results show that accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure of CADSE system are greater than 94%, 92%, 92%, and 93%, respectively that prove the system efficiency.}

This approach is named as NN-ARIMA. Neural Network MLP is employed to capture network-scale co-movement pattern of all traffic flows, and ARIMA is used to further extract location-specific traffic features in the residual time series out of Neural Network. The experiment results show that the postprocessing the residuals of Neural Network by the ARIMA analysis helps to significantly improve accuracy of traffic state prediction by 8.9–13.4% in term of mean squared error reduction. In order to verify the efficiency of the ARIMA analysis in the postprocessing, Multidimensional Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model is also employed to replace the role of Neural Network in the comparative experiment. Two streams of comparisons, (1) NN vs. NN-ARIMA and (2) MSVR vs. MSVR-ARIMA, are performed and show consistent results. The proposed approach not only can capture network-wide co-movement pattern of traffic flows, but also seize location-specific traffic characteristics as well as sharp nonlinearity of macroscopic traffic variables. The case study indicates that the accuracy of prediction can be significantly improved when both network-scale traffic features and location-specific characteristics are taken into account.}

As users handle smartphones for various purposes and their preferences determine different device positions while traveling, accelerometer and gyroscope, for instance, often present ambiguities that prevent accurate stop detection. To mitigate the impact of these ambiguities, we combine spatial time-series, i.e. GPS, with spatial context information retrieved from Open Street Map, which we represent as multi-dimension tensors. This project explores simple representations, such as dummy variables, and novel multidimensional representations, which are bench-marked through the classification performance of specialized artificial neural network (ANN), as well as other machine learning (ML) baselines.

This personalization capacity builds on accurate modeling of user behaviors; however, in practice, a user’s behavior data is often limited, and his preferences in the discrete choice-making process may change or evolve. In this paper, we propose a new online-updating model that can accurately and efficiently estimate an individual’s preferences from his discrete choices. Our model is built on the concept of canonical structure, where a set of canonical models are identified as the common preference patterns shared by the whole population, and a membership vector is also identified for each individual to capture the degrees of the resemblance of his preferences to those common preference patterns. To allow preference to vary in the choice-making process, a time-varying model can be integrated with the canonical structure. In the current study, we use a simple cubic polynomial model with a single variant and show the detailed formulation of the integrated model. An online-updating strategy is also proposed, such that it is possible to update the parameters partially in practice. The proposed model is suitable for modeling a heterogeneous population with insufficient data from each individual. Both simulation studies and a real-world application are taken in the current study. The results show that comparing with other frequently used models, the model we proposed has the highest accuracy in preference learning and behavior prediction.}

Over 1 million vehicles, with different powertrain types (conventional and numerous electrified powertrains) and component technologies (advanced engines, batteries, electrical machines, light weighting) are simulated for outputs including vehicle fuel economy and cost. Despite the ability of Autonomie to predict fuel economy given various combination of vehicle inputs, the full-vehicle simulation is very time-consuming. It takes approximately 84 h to simulate for 33,060 vehicles even using distributed computing on a cluster of 128 worker nodes. Moreover, Autonomie is unable to populate a continuous output space through simulation since it only yields outputs with discrete values instead of an input-output relation. This paper proposes a novel large-scale learning and prediction process (LSLPP) via machine learning approaches to answer the need for a continuous space of vehicle fuel economy and a more efficient simulation process. By learning in a supervised fashion to discover structures in data, the machine learning approaches seek to train a model that can explain the data with which we can perform prediction over unseen data. As such, we are able to accomplish analytic continuation on the current discrete space of simulation results. In addition, we present a random-sampling-based numerosity reduction algorithm incorporated in LSLPP that reduces simulation runs and improves efficiency of data procurement. We analytically derive a theoretical bound in order to guarantee the effectiveness of our algorithm. We also compare random sampling to stratified sampling and suggest sampling strategies. A user-friendly tool is developed to support the process. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed LSLPP is able to greatly accelerate prediction and analysis of vehicle fuel economy. The output of this study is used by the US government to evaluate the impact of its R&D funding on energy security and CO2 emission as well as for the setting of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.}

abstract = {Ride-hailing platforms generally provide various service options to customers, such as solo ride services, shared ride services, etc. It is generally expected that demands for different service modes are correlated, and the prediction of demand for one service mode can benefit from historical observations of demands for other service modes. Moreover, an accurate joint prediction of demands for multiple service modes can help the platforms better allocate and dispatch vehicle resources. Although there is a large stream of literature on ride-hailing demand predictions for one specific service mode, few efforts have been paid towards joint predictions of ride-hailing demands for multiple service modes. To address this issue, we propose a deep multi-task multi-graph learning approach, which combines two components: (1) multiple multi-graph convolutional (MGC) networks for predicting demands for different service modes, and (2) multi-task learning modules that enable knowledge sharing across multiple MGC networks. More specifically, two multi-task learning structures are established. The first one is the regularized cross-task learning, which builds cross-task connections among the inputs and outputs of multiple MGC networks. The second one is the multi-linear relationship learning, which imposes a prior tensor normal distribution on the weights of various MGC networks. Although there are no concrete bridges between different MGC networks, the weights of these networks are constrained by each other and subject to a common prior distribution. Evaluated with the for-hire-vehicle datasets in Manhattan, we show that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms in prediction accuracy for different ride-hailing modes.}

abstract = {Knock-on delay, which is the key factor in punctuality of railway service, is mainly related to two factors including the quality of timetable in the planning phase and disturbances which may result in unscheduled trains’ waiting or meeting in operation phase. If the delay root cause and the interactions among the factors responsible for these can be clearly clarified, then the punctuality of railway operations can be enhanced by taking reactions such as timetable adjustment, rescheduling or rerouting of railway traffic in case of disturbances. These delay reasons can be used to predict the lengths of railway disruptions and effective reactions can be applied in disruption management. In this work, a delay root cause discovery model is proposed, which integrates heterogeneous railway operation data sources to reconstruct the details of the railway operations. A supervised decision tree method following the machine learning and data mining techniques is designed to estimate the key factors in knock-on delays. It discovers the root cause delay factor by logically analyzing the scheduled or un-scheduled trains meetings and overtaking behaviors, and the subsequent delay propagations. Experiment results show that the proposed decision tree can predict the delay reason with the accuracy of 83%, and it can be further enhance to 90% if the delay cause is only considered “prolonged passengers boarding” and “meeting or overtaking” factors. The delay root cause can be discovered by the proposed model, verified by frequency filtering in operation records, and resolved by the adjustment of timetable which is an important reference for the next timetable rescheduling. The results of this study can be applied to railway operation decision support and disruption management, especially with regard to timetable rescheduling, trains resequencing or rerouting, system reliability analysis, and service quality improvements.}

Until we get the necessary information from aircraft and until new more accurate methods are implemented and used, we propose an alternative method for predicting aircraft performances using machine learning from historical data about past flights collected in a multidimensional database. In that way, we can improve existing applications by providing them better inputs for their trajectory calculations. Our method uses flight plan data to predict performance values, which are suited individually for each flight. The results show that based on recorded past aircraft performances and related flight data we can effectively predict performances for future flights based on how similar flights behaved in the past.}

However, the AVI observations are too sparse to infer the specific chosen route and OD pair, which discourages its application on route choice model estimation. To tackle this issue, this paper develops a semi-supervised learning method that can train the route choice model with sparse AVI observations. First of all, the likelihood function in Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure was derived by decomposing the AVI trace into observation pairs. Combined with high-resolution GPS observations, the measurement equation and OD inference model were then defined to deal with the sparsity problem of AVI observations. At the same time, the Mixed Logit model was introduced to capture the correlation and heterogeneity across the choice behavior between different observation pairs. Finally, the relationship between route choice model and the likelihood function was established and the unknown parameters in route choice model can be estimated by seeking a maximum to the log-likelihood function. Empirical studies were conducted with field-testing data in this paper. The estimated results show that the proposed semi-supervised method improved the identification accuracy of route choice model significantly without sacrificing interpretability. The evaluation of the computational efficiency presented the potential of the semi-supervised method to learn route choice behavior for a large-size sample set. The sensitivity analysis was also performed to illustrate how robust the proposed method is. This is the first research that attempts to apply AVI data on route choice model and it endows the high-penetration AVI data with great practical value for modeling the route choice behavior of city-wide samples over a long period.}

To date, driver trust in automated vehicle technologies has mostly been estimated by subjective data. Currently available objective measures of driver trust primarily rely on self-reported ratings as the ground truth, while the largely reported inconsistency between drivers’ self-reported trust levels and observed actual behavior suggests that drivers’ trust measures shall not solely rely on subjective reporting values. To address the issue, this study proposes an objective method to assess and predict driver trust in automated vehicle technologies, by using the transition probability matrix of drivers’ hand positions during automated vehicle system engagement. An on-road experiment was conducted on public roadways in real traffic. Data on use frequencies of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-reported trust ratings were collected and combined in classifying driver trust levels: lower, medium, and higher based on the K-means clustering results. Drivers’ hand positions during ADAS engagement (i.e., during lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist system uses) were then found closely associated with their trust levels. Differences of frequencies and transition probabilities for hand positions were further compared within and across the three trust groups. Results showed that drivers from the lower, medium, and higher trust groups were more likely to keep hands on the top, mid, and low positions of the wheel, respectively. Factors affecting driver trust in automated vehicle technologies were also explored through mixed model analyses. Middle-aged drivers placed more trust in ADAS than younger drivers, while female drivers exhibited greater trust than male drivers. The Random Forests algorithm was applied to build a prediction model for driver trust in automated vehicle technologies, by inputting the hand position transition probability matrix, age, gender, and ADAS types as independent variables. The overall prediction accuracy was approximately 80%. Findings in this study could contribute to the objective and real-time estimations of driver trust in automated vehicle technologies.}

To overcome bias introduced by data generated from only fitness app users, researchers build statistical models that predict total bicycling by integrating Strava data with official counts and geographic data. However, studies conducted on single cities provide limited insight on best practices for modeling bicycling with Strava as generalizability is difficult to assess. Our goal is to develop a generalized approach to modeling bicycling ridership using Strava data. In doing so we enable detailed mapping that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and will support more equitable decision-making across cities. We used Strava data, official counts, and geographic data to model Average Annual Daily Bicycling (AADB) in five cities: Boulder, Ottawa, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Victoria. Using a machine learning approach, LASSO, we identify variables important for predicting ridership in all cities, and independently in each city. Using the LASSO-selected variables as predictors in Poisson regression, we built generalized and city-specific models and compared accuracy. Our results indicate generalized prediction of bicycling ridership on a road segment in concert with Strava data should include the following variables: number of Strava riders, percentage of Strava trips categorized as commuting, bicycling safety, and income. Inclusion of city-specific variables increased model performance, as the R2 for generalized and city-specific models ranged from 0.08–0.80 and 0.68–0.92, respectively. However, model accuracy was influenced most by the official count data used for model training. For best results, official count data should capture diverse street conditions, including low ridership areas. Counts collected continuously over a long time period, rather than at peak periods, may also improve modeling. Modeling bicycling from Strava and geographic data enables mapping of bicycling ridership that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and better able to support decision-making.}

In parallel, mobile phone data have emerged as the largest mobility data source, but are not yet integrated to transport planning models. Currently, transport authorities are lacking a global picture of daily passenger flows on multimodal transport networks. In this work, we propose the first methodology to infer dynamic Origin-Destination flows by transport modes using mobile network data e.g., Call Detail Records. For this study, we pre-process 360 million trajectories for more than 2 million devices from the Greater Paris as our case study region. The model combines mobile network geolocation with transport network geospatial data, travel survey, census and travel card data. The transport modes of mobile network trajectories are identified through a two-steps semi-supervised learning algorithm. The later involves clustering of mobile network areas and Bayesian inference to generate transport probabilities for trajectories. After attributing the mode with highest probability to each trajectory, we construct Origin-Destination matrices by transport mode. Flows are up-scaled to the total population using state-of-the-art expansion factors. The model generates time variant road and rail passenger flows for the complete region. From our results, we observe different mobility patterns for road and rail modes and between Paris and its suburbs. The resulting transport flows are extensively validated against the travel survey and the travel card data for different spatial scales.}

The results show that peer pressure helps in achieving desirable equilibrium properties while reducing congestion and emissions due to sustained mode shift. With a way to initiate the required social norming and a proper concern for privacy and ethics, these cost-effective mechanisms may soon begin to find use in improving community welfare.}

Three probabilistic approaches for the fusion of VIS and IR images are presented. The early fusion at the feature level yields a bimodal feature vector integrating both VIS and IR data, used to feed an SVM-based classifier. An intermediate fusion at the kernel level combines two different monomodal kernels in order to obtain a particularly flexible Bimodal Kernel (BK), we believe more appropriate for heterogeneous VIS and IR data classification with SVM. The late fusion combines matching scores provided by VIS and IR obstacle recognition modules in order to improve the system performance. An important advantage of these fusion schemes is their capability to adapt to the environmental illumination changes and specific weather conditions due to a modality weighting parameter which allows to adjust the decision of the system according to the relative importance of the VIS and IR modalities. Experiments performed on the TetraVision image database showed that all our fusion-based obstacle classifiers outperform both monomodal VIS and IR obstacle recognizers. The matching score fusion with a dynamic weighting scheme provides the best results compared with both early and intermediate fusion schemes using static modality weights. The BK scheme we propose for VIS–IR fusion would need a greater and better balanced database for learning improvement, since the BK has much more hyper-parameters to be simultaneously optimized than the matching-score fusion.}

abstract = {Knowledge of trip travel times serves an important role in transportation management and control. Existing travel time estimation approaches generally cover empirical ones, statistical ones and hybrid ones. Despite strong tractability, the empirical approaches cannot sufficiently capture diverse travel time distributions (TTDs) and often encounter some issues (e.g., assumption of a predefined distribution, failure of significance tests). Statistical and hybrid methods possess better generalization in estimating heterogeneous TTDs, but fail to model the network-wide spatiotemporal correlations, which have been found useful in the TTD estimation. To address these drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep learning based Trip Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (T-InfoGAN). In this method, the trip TTD is estimated by modeling the joint distribution of travel times of two successive links with the consideration of network-wide spatiotemporal correlations. Meanwhile, a dynamic clustering with Wasserstein distance (DCWD) algorithm is used to explore the traffic state transitions for link pairs and cluster the link pairs with similar TTDs into one group, which benefits the training and estimation processes of T-InfoGAN. Then, based on GPS trajectory data from Didi Chuxing in Chengdu city, China, numerical results show that the T-InfoGAN with DCWD can well estimate three mini trip TTDs with various features, and performs better than three other counterparts (i.e., Convolution method, MC-Grid method, and MC-GMMS method) in estimating the TTDs of two longer trips. In summary, this study is the first successful try to estimate trip TTDs within the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and the deep learning based T-InfoGAN is a promising approach to estimate heterogeneous trip TTDs with the better generalization and flexibility in the big data era.}

Second, the proposed model strikes a delicate balance between model complexity and accuracy. In contrast to the existing models that view a sensor network as a weighted graph and use graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) to model spatial dependency, we represent a sensor network as an image and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the prediction model. The image is generated by the correlation coefficient between the flow series of sensors, which is different from other CNN based prediction approaches that convert the transportation network into an image by the spatial location of sensors or regions. Compared with the GCNN based model, the CNN based DeepTrend 2.0 can achieve much faster convergence during training, and it guarantees similar prediction quality. Test results indicate that the proposed light-weighted model is efficient and easy to transfer and deploy.}

The methodology uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classifier to classify individual data points into one of four basic vehicle flow states (Free Flow, Stopped, Acceleration, and Deceleration) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify ‘stop and go’ segments in the trajectory. The identification of vehicle flow state is used for varying the sampling rate. The proposed SAS method can reduce the total amount of data by 67–77%, while keeping the most critical data points.

However, developing an accurate prediction model is challenging as the traffic data of crash and non-crash cases are extremely imbalanced. Most of the previous studies undersampled non-crash cases to balance the data, which may not capture the heterogeneity of the full non-crash data. This study aims to use the emerging deep learning method called deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) model to fully understand the traffic data leading to crashes. With the full understanding of the traffic data of crashes, the DCGAN model could generate more synthetic data related to crashes to balance the dataset. All non-crash data could be used for developing the prediction models. To capture the correlations between different variables, the data are augmented to 2-D matrix as the input for the DCGAN model. The suggested model is evaluated based on data from expressways and compared to two counterparts: (1) synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE); (2) random undersampling technique. The results suggest that the DCGAN could better understand the crash data characteristics by generating data with better fit of the real data distribution. Four different crash prediction algorithms (i.e., logistic regression model, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and convolutional neural network) are developed based on each balanced data and totally twelve models were estimated. The results indicate that the convolutional neural network model based on the DCGAN balanced data could provide the best prediction accuracy, validating that the proposed oversampling method could be used for the data balance. Besides, compared to other two models, only the DCGAN-based model could identify the significant effects of speed difference between the upstream and downstream locations which could help guide traffic management strategies. With the prediction model developed based on the balanced data by DCGAN, it is expected that more crashes could be predicted and prevented with more appropriate proactive traffic safety management strategies such as Variable Speed Limits (VSL) and Dynamic Message Signs (DMS).}

This inspires us to introduce the application of attentions for traffic flow prediction. In this study, a deep learning based traffic flow predictor with spatial and temporal attentions (STANN) is proposed. The spatial and temporal attentions are used to exploit the spatial dependencies between road segments and temporal dependencies between time steps respectively. Experiment results with a real-world traffic dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.

Traditional travel surveys generally observe resident travel behavior and rarely target tourists. Ubiquitous uses of social media platforms in smartphones have created a tremendous opportunity to gather digital traces of tourists at a large scale. In this paper, we present a framework on how to use location-based data from social media to gather and analyze travel behavior of tourists. We have collected data of about 67,000 users from Twitter using its search interface for Florida. We first propose several filtering steps to create a reliable sample from the collected Twitter data. An ensemble classification technique is proposed to classify tourists and residents from user coordinates. The accuracy of the proposed classifier has been compared against the state-of-the-art classification methods. Finally, different clustering methods have been used to find the spatial patterns of destination choices of tourists. Promising results have been found from the output clusters as they reveal most popular tourist spots as well as some of the emerging tourist attractions in Florida. Performance of the proposed clustering techniques has been assessed using internal clustering validation indices. We have analyzed temporal patterns of tourist and resident activities to validate the classification of the users in two separate groups of tourists and residents. Proposed filtering, identification, and clustering techniques will be significantly useful for building individual-level tourist travel demand models from social media data.}

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop and evaluate a hybrid travel time forecasting model with geographic information systems (GIS) technologies for predicting link travel times in congested road networks. In a separate study by You and Kim (cf. You, J., Kim, T.J., 1999b. In: Proceedings of the Third Bi-Annual Conference of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 14–17 September, Taipei, Taiwan), a non-parametric regression model has been developed as a core forecasting algorithm to reduce computation time and increase forecasting accuracy. Using the core forecasting algorithm, a prototype hybrid forecasting model has been developed and tested by deploying GIS technologies in the following areas: (1) storing, retrieving, and displaying traffic data to assist in the forecasting procedures, (2) building road network data, and (3) integrating historical databases and road network data. This study shows that adopting GIS technologies in link travel time forecasting is efficient for achieving two goals: (1) reducing computational delay and (2) increasing forecasting accuracy.}

While large-scale LPR system is not common in US, last few years have seen rapid developments and implementations in many other parts of world (e.g. China, Thailand and Middle East). Due to privacy issues, LPR data are seldom available to research communities. However, when available, this data source can be valuable in estimating real-time operational metrics in transportation systems. This paper proposes a lane-based real-time queue length estimation model using the license plate recognition (LPR) data. In the model, an interpolation method based on Gaussian process is developed to reconstruct the equivalent cumulative arrival–departure curve for each lane. The missing information for unrecognized or unmatched vehicles is obtained from the reconstructed arrival curve. With the complete arrival and departure information, a car-following based simulation scheme is applied to estimate the real-time queue length for each lane. The proposed model is validated using ground truth information of the maximum queue lengths from the city of Langfang in China. The results show that the model can capture the variations in queue lengths in the ground truth data, and the maximum queue length for each signal cycle can be estimated with a reasonable accuracy. The estimated queue length information using the proposed model can serve as a useful performance metric for various real-time traffic control applications.}

abstract = {Bridges are critical components of highways ensuring traffic can efficiently travel over obstructions such as bodies of water, valleys, and other roads. Ensuring bridges are in sound structural condition is essential for safe and efficient highway operations. Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems designed to measure bridge responses have been developed to quantitatively track the health of bridges. More recently, SHM systems have also begun to integrate measurement of vehicular loads that create the responses measured. However, precise correlation of traffic loads to bridge responses remains a costly and technically difficult strategy. To address existing technical limitations, a cyber-physical system (CPS) framework is proposed to track truck loads in a highway corridor, to trigger SHM systems to record bridge responses, and to automate the linking of bridge response data with truck weights collected by weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations installed along the corridor but not collocated with the bridges. To link truck weights to bridge responses, computer vision methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to automate the detection and reidentification of trucks using traffic cameras. The single-stage CNN object detector YOLO is trained using a customized dataset to identify trucks from camera images at each instrumentation site; high precision is obtained with the YOLO detector exceeding 95% average precision (AP) for an intersection over union (IOU) threshold of 0.75. To reidentify the same truck at different locations in the corridor, this study adopts a CNN-based encoder trained via a triplet network and a mutual nearest neighbor strategy using feature vectors extracted from images at each measurement location. The proposed reidentification method is implemented in the CPS cloud environment and obtains a F1-score of 0.97. The study also explores the triggering of bridge monitoring systems based on visual detection of trucks by a traffic camera installed upstream to the bridges. The triggering strategy proves to be highly efficient with 99% of the triggered data collection cycles capturing truck events at each bridge. To validate, the CPS architecture is implemented on a 20-mile highway corridor that has a WIM station already installed; four traffic cameras and two bridge SHM systems are installed along the corridor and integrated with a CPS architecture hosted on the cloud. In total, over 10,000 trucks are observed at all measurement locations over one year allowing peak bridge responses to be correlated to both measured truck weights and to one another.}

abstract = {License-plate recognition (LPR) technology has been widely applied in many different transportation applications such as enforcement, vehicle monitoring, and access control. Recently, there has been effort to exploit an LPR database for vehicle tracking using popular template matching procedures. Existing template matching procedures assume that the true reference string is always available. However, under a two-point LPR survey, a vehicle could have its plate misread at both locations generating a pair of misread strings (or templates) with no reference for matching. To compensate for LPR misreading problem, we propose a new weight function based on a probability model to match the observed outcomes of a dual LPR setup. Also, considering that reversal errors are never made in LPR machines, new editing constraints as a function of the string lengths are proposed to avoid compensation for reversal errors. These editing constraints are incorporated into the constraint edit distance formulation to improve the performance of the matching procedure. Finally, considering that previous template matching procedures do not take advantage of passage time information available in LPR databases, we present an online tracking procedure that considers the properties of probability distribution of vehicle journey times in order to increase the probability of correct matches. Experimental results show that our proposed procedure can improve the accuracy of LPR systems and achieve up to 97% of positive matches with no false matches. Further research is needed to extend the ideas proposed herein to plate-matching with multiple, i.e., more than two, LPR units.}

Most data is kept private for many reasons, including commercial and security concerns. More than data, shared information is precious, as it leverages intelligent decision-making support tools designed to smoothen daily operations. We present a framework to detect, identify and characterise anomalies in past aircraft trajectory data. It is based on an open source of ADS-B based aircraft trajectories, and extracted information can benefit a wide range of stakeholders: Air Traffic Control (ATC) training centres could play more realistic simulations; ANSP may improve capacity indicators; academics improve safety models and risk estimations; and commercial stakeholders, like airlines and airports, may use such information to improve short-term predictions and optimise their operations. The technique is based on autoencoding artificial neural networks applied on flows of trajectories, which provide a useful reading grid associating cluster analysis with quantified level of abnormality. In particular, we find that the highest anomaly scores correspond to poor weather conditions, whereas anomalies with a lower score relate to ATC tactical actions.}

By assessing requirements and opportunities, the controller aims to limit consecutive delays resulting from trains that entered a control area behind schedule by sequencing them at a critical location in a timely manner, thus representing the practical requirements of railway operations. This approach depends on an approximation to the value function of dynamic programming after optimisation from a specified state, which is estimated dynamically from operational experience using reinforcement learning techniques. By using this approximation, the ADP avoids extensive explicit evaluation of performance and so reduces the computational burden substantially. In this investigation, we explore formulations of the approximation function and variants of the learning techniques used to estimate it. Evaluation of the ADP methods in a stochastic simulation environment shows considerable improvements in consecutive delays by comparison with the current industry practice of First-Come-First-Served sequencing. We also found that estimates of parameters of the approximate value function are similar across a range of test scenarios with different mean train entry delays.}

Individual preferences are learned to provide personalized incentives so that the promoted alternative is likely accepted. Using knowledge from control theories and state estimation, we model travelers’ choice-making behaviors with the random utility theory and responses from the individuals are mined by a particle filter for learning individual preferences to promote sustainable behaviors. The discrete nature of travel behavior naturally leads to limited observability. We overcome this problem by designing a measurement function from which additional information can be solicited. Additionally, the inherent trade-offs between factors that affect travel choices result in an infinite set of solutions. We thus propose two solutions: (1) the divide and conquer strategy in which a multi-dimensional conditional probability function is proposed; and (2) use of domain knowledge to restrict that preference values fall in certain ranges and are consistent with certain distributions. The performance of preference learning with these two solutions applied is shown via simulation tests and an online experiment involving human participants. For departure time choices, we show an average acceptance ratio of 0.68 for all participants when being promoted with alternatives with personalized incentives. We also show that changes in individual departure time choices will lead to 48% reduction in total travel time on a simple transportation network.}

abstract = {Urban traffic is subject to disturbances that cause long queues and extended waiting times at signalized intersections. Although Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) were considered to control traffic at signalized intersections in a distributed way, their generic conceptual framework and lack of built-in adaptation mechanisms prevent them from achieving specific disturbance management capabilities. The traffic signal control problem is still a challenging open-ended problem for which learning and adaptation mechanisms need to be developed to deal with disturbances in an intelligent way. In this article, we rely on concepts and mechanisms inspired by biological immunity to design a distributed, intelligent and adaptive traffic signal control system. We suggest a heterarchical multi-agent architecture, where each agent represents a traffic signal controller assigned to a signalized intersection. Each agent communicates and coordinates with neighboring agents, and achieves learning and adaptation to disturbances based on an artificial immune network. The suggested Immune Network Algorithm based Multi-Agent System (INAMAS) provides intelligent mechanisms that capture disturbance-related knowledge explicitly and take advantage of previous successes and failures in dealing with disturbances through an adaptation of the reinforcement principle. To demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested control architecture, we assess its performance against two control strategies from literature, namely fixed-time control and a distributed adaptation of the Longest Queue First – Maximal Weight Matching (LQF-MWM) algorithm. Agents are developed using SPADE platform and used to control a network of signalized intersections simulated with VISSIM, a state-of-the-art traffic simulation software. The results show that INAMAS is able to handle different traffic scenarios with competitive performance (in terms of vehicle queue lengths and waiting times), and that it is particularly more successful than the other controllers in dealing with extreme situations involving blocked approaches and high traffic volumes.}

It contains two aspects: dynamic rebalancing within each station and static rebalancing among stations. Firstly, we give a new flow-type task window (F-window) by defining the consistency index of travelers. It is more suitable as a task window for rebalancing than time-type task window (T-window) based on three aspects analysis. Through three assumptions, the temporal-distribution learning model including task window and station storage configuration, are built to realize new dynamic rebalancing. The spatial-distribution learning method is introduced to divide management areas for static rebalancing. The empirical results show that F-window can better match the strong time-sensitive of demand fluctuation. Compared with traditional rebalancing needs hours, each rebalancing within a station can be completed within average 4 min. By setting the station storage configuration, it makes rebalancing in this paper meets the demand of 28.3 times the hourly rebalancing within one week. And the number of vehicles visiting stations has dropped below 20%.}

The NGSIM data are used to calibrate and validate the proposed CF model. Meanwhile, three characteristics closely related to the asymmetric driving behavior are investigated: hysteresis, discrete driving, and intensity difference. The simulation results show the good performance of the proposed CF model on reproducing realistic traffic flow features. Moreover, to further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CF model, two other CF models including recurrent neural network based CF model and asymmetric full velocity difference model, are compared with LSTM-NN model. The results reveal that LSTM-NN model can capture the asymmetric driving behavior well and outperforms other models.}

This paper develops a short-term traffic states forecasting algorithm based on partial least square (PLS) to help enhance real-time decision-making and build better insights into traffic data. The proposed model is capable of predicting short-term traffic states accurately and efficiently by capturing dominant spatiotemporal features and day-to-day variations from collinear and correlated traffic data.

A brief introduction to the techniques is provided for the benefit of the readers unfamiliar with the techniques.

The control algorithm is built on approximate dynamic programming (ADP). This approach substantially reduces computational burden by using an approximation to the value function of the dynamic programming and reinforcement learning to update the approximation. We investigate temporal-difference learning and perturbation learning as specific learning techniques for the ADP approach. We find in computer simulation that the ADP controllers achieve substantial reduction in vehicle delays in comparison with optimised fixed-time plans. Our results show that substantial benefits can be gained by increasing the frequency at which the signal plans are revised, which can be achieved conveniently using the ADP approach.}

This is challenging since travel behaviors vary significantly over the population, space, and time and developing meaningful links between them and traveler attributes are not trivial. To achieve this, we conduct an extensive analysis of spatio-temporal travel behavior patterns using smart card data from the Greater Sydney area (Opal card), and then develop a Hybrid Neural Network to utilize spatial and temporal dependencies in the dataset. In particular, we first empirically analyze passengers’ movements and mobility patterns from both spatial and temporal perspectives and design a set of discriminative features to characterize the patterns. We then propose a deep-learning-based framework to investigate spatial and temporal features in order to infer traveler attributes. The proposed modeling framework consists of two components, i.e., a Product-based Spatial–Temporal Module (PSTM) and an Auto-Encoder-based Compression Module (AECM). PSTM encodes the relationships across a variety of features while AECM derives useful spatial information from a transit stop matrix. The proposed model is tested and evaluated using a large-scale public transport dataset in the Greater Sydney area to infer two attributes of passengers, i.e., the age group and residential area. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against a number of established tools in the literature. The developed techniques can be potentially adapted to other domains where spatio-temporal features are critical, such as commercial/entertainment site selection and urban service planning.}

AARs are dependent on selected runway configurations and both are affected by weather conditions. Although there have been studies tackling on the prediction of AARs or runway configurations or both, the prediction accuracy is relatively low and only single airport is considered. This study presents a data-driven deep-learning framework for predicting both runway configurations and AARs to support efficient air traffic management for complex multi-airport systems. The two major contributions from this work are 1) the proposed model uses assembled gridded weather forecast for the terminal airspace instead of an isolated station-based terminal weather forecast, and 2) the model captures the operational interdependency aspects inherent in the parameter learning process so that proposed modeling framework can predict both runway configuration and AARs simultaneously with higher accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated with a numerical experiment taking three major airports in New York Metroplex as the case study. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method is compared with methods in current literature and the analysis results show that the proposed method outperforms all existing methods.}

abstract = {This paper presents a data-driven hybrid control (DDHC) framework that can arrange adaptive control strategies for vehicles to effectively improve the transit performance of the public transport system. The framework depicts a powerful combination of a data-driven control method that is used to imitate the control behaviour of dispatchers and a mathematical optimization method. Three components comprise the DDHC framework: a data-driven control module, a performance module, and an optimization module. The data-driven control module contains a random forest model which is adopted to justify whether to intervene in the operation of a bus line, and if so, which vehicles should be controlled and what type of control strategy should be taken – an acceleration strategy or deceleration strategy. The performance module including vehicle operation state models is used to describe the system evolution. The last component optimizes the specific control actions – which type of acceleration or deceleration strategy should be adopted – by minimizing total passenger travel time. The effectiveness of the proposed DDHC framework is evaluated with the data of a transit route in Urumqi, China. The results show that the DDHC framework with reasonable parameters can suit the needs of real-time control in complex traffic environments.}

abstract = {Classification of congestion patterns is important in many areas in traffic planning and management, ranging from policy appraisal, database design, to prediction and real-time control. One of the key constraints in applying machine learning techniques for classification is the availability of sufficient data (traffic patterns) with clear and undisputed labels, e.g. traffic pattern X or Y. The challenge is that labelling traffic patterns (e.g. combinations of congested and freely flow areas over time and space) is highly subjective. In our view this means that assessment of how well algorithms label the data should also include a qualitative component that focuses on what the found patterns really mean for traffic flow operations and applications. In this study, we investigate the application of clustering analysis to obtain labels automatically from the data, where we indeed first qualitatively assess how meaningful the found labels are, and subsequently test quantitatively how well the labels separate the resulting feature space. By transforming traffic measurements (speeds) into (colored) images, two different approaches are proposed to extract the features of a large number of traffic patterns for clustering: point-based and area-based. The point-based approach is widely applied in the image processing literature, and explores local interest points in images (i.e. where large changes occur in color intensity); whereas a new area-based approach combines domain knowledge with Watershed segmentation to partition the images into different spatial-temporal segments from which domain specific features, such as wide moving jam patterns, are extracted. The results show that the Watershed segmentation separates the traffic (congestion) patterns into more meaningful and separable classes, comparable to those that have been proposed in the literature. Since there is no ground-truth set of labels, the quantitative assessment tests how well both methods are able to separate the respective feature spaces they construct for the (large) database of traffic patterns. We argue that the more crisp this separation is; the better the labelling has turned out. For this quantitative comparison we train a multinomial classifier that maps unseen patterns to the labels discovered by each of the two labeling approaches. The most important result is that the classifier using the area-based feature vector achieves the highest average levels of confidence in its decisions to classify patterns, implying a highly separable feature vector space. We argue this is good news! Not only does the combination of image processing (Watershed) and domain knowledge (traffic flow characteristics) lead to meaningful labels that can be automatically retrieved from large databases of data; this method also leads to a more efficient separation of the resulting feature space. Our next endeavor is to further refine and use this method to develop a search engine for the (rapidly growing) 200 TB historical database of traffic data hosted by the Dutch National Datawarehouse (NDW).}

Bayesian networks (BNs) provide the ability to investigate causality and is showing value in recent literature to generate synthetic populations. This paper is novel in extending the application of BNs to daily activity tours. Results show that BNs can synthesise both activity and trip chain structures accurately. It outperforms a frequentist approach and can cater for infrequently observed activity patterns, and patterns unobserved in small sample data. It can also account for temporal variables like activity duration.}

abstract = {Short-term origin–destination (OD) flow prediction in urban rail transit (URT) plays a crucial role in smart and real-time URT operation and management. Different from other short-term traffic forecasting methods, the short-term OD flow prediction possesses three unique characteristics: (1) data availability: real-time OD flow is not available during the prediction; (2) data dimensionality: the dimension of the OD flow is much higher than the cardinality of transportation networks; (3) data sparsity: URT OD flow is spatiotemporally sparse. There is a great need to develop novel OD flow forecasting method that explicitly considers the unique characteristics of the URT system. To this end, a channel-wise attentive split–convolutional neural network (CAS-CNN) is proposed. The proposed model consists of many novel components such as the channel-wise attention mechanism and split CNN. In particular, an inflow/outflow-gated mechanism is innovatively introduced to address the data availability issue. We further originally propose a masked loss function to solve the data dimensionality and data sparsity issues. The model interpretability is also discussed in detail. The CAS–CNN model is tested on two large-scale real-world datasets from Beijing Subway, and it outperforms the rest of benchmarking methods. The proposed model contributes to the development of short-term OD flow prediction, and it also lays the foundations of real-time URT operation and management.}

The scarce long-term estimation strategies currently found in the literature are commonly based on the detection and assignment to patterns, but their performance decays when unexpected events provoke non predictable changes, or if the allocation to a traffic pattern is inaccurate. This work introduces a method to obtain long-term pattern forecasts and adapt them to real-time circumstances. To this end, a long-term estimation scheme based on the automated discovery of patterns is proposed and integrated with an on-line change detection and adaptation mechanism. The framework takes advantage of the architecture of evolving Spiking Neural Networks (eSNN) to perform adaptations without retraining the model, allowing the whole system to work autonomously in an on-line fashion. Its performance is assessed over a real scenario with 5 min data of a 6-month span of traffic in the center of Madrid, Spain. Significant accuracy gains are obtained when applying the proposed on-line adaptation mechanism on days with special, non-predictable events that degrade the quality of their long-term traffic forecasts.}

Demand prediction is one of the most fundamental components in supply-demand management systems of ride-sourcing platforms. With an accurate short-term prediction for origin-destination (OD) demand, the platforms make precise and timely decisions on real-time matching, idle vehicle reallocations, and ride-sharing vehicle routing, etc. Compared to the zone-based demand prediction that has been examined in many previous studies, OD-based demand prediction is more challenging. This is mainly due to the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among the demand of different OD pairs. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder Residual Multi-Graph Convolutional network (ST-ED-RMGC), a novel deep learning model for predicting ride-sourcing demand of various OD pairs. Firstly, the model constructs OD graphs, which utilize adjacent matrices to characterize the non-Euclidean pair-wise geographical and semantic correlations among different OD pairs. Secondly, based on the constructed graphs, a residual multi-graph convolutional (RMGC) network is designed to encode the contextual-aware spatial dependencies, and a long-short term memory (LSTM) network is used to encode the temporal dependencies, into a dense vector space. Finally, we reuse the RMGC networks to decode the compressed vector back to OD graphs and predict the future OD demand. Through extensive experiments on the for-hire-vehicles datasets in Manhattan, New York City, we show that our proposed deep learning framework outperforms the state-of-arts by a significant margin.}

abstract = {Vehicle detection in traffic surveillance images is an important approach to obtain vehicle data and rich traffic flow parameters. Recently, deep learning based methods have been widely used in vehicle detection with high accuracy and efficiency. However, deep learning based methods require a large number of manually labeled ground truths (bounding box of each vehicle in each image) to train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the modern urban surveillance cameras, there are already many manually labeled ground truths in daytime images for training CNN, while there are little or much less manually labeled ground truths in nighttime images. In this paper, we focus on the research to make maximum usage of labeled daytime images (Source Domain) to help the vehicle detection in unlabeled nighttime images (Target Domain). For this purpose, we propose a new situation-sensitive method based on Faster R-CNN with Domain Adaptation (DA) to improve the vehicle detection at nighttime. Furthermore, a situation-sensitive traffic flow parameter estimation method is developed based on the traffic flow theory. We collected a new dataset of 2,200 traffic images (1,200 for daytime and 1,000 for nighttime) of 57,059 vehicles to evaluate the proposed method for the vehicle detection. Another new dataset with three 1,800-frame daytime videos and one 1,800-frame nighttime video of about 260 K vehicles was collected to evaluate and show the estimated traffic flow parameters in different situations. The experimental results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Using operational data from the reservation platform of the paratransit services in Toulouse, France, and enriching them with exogenous information, the study derives statistical and deep learning models for medium-term forecast. These models include a seasonal ARIMAX model with rolling forecast, a Random Forest Regressor, a LSTM neural network with exogenous information and a CNN neural network with independent variables. The seasonal ARIMAX model yields the best performance, suggesting that when linear relationships are considered, econometric models and deep learning models do not have significant differences in their performance. All the models show limited ability to grasp unique events with multi-day impacts such as strikes. Albeit a highly volatile demand and limited knowledge ahead of the forecast, these models suggest the volume of early reservations is a good proxy for the daily demand.}

Two SVMs, each with a different non-linear kernel function, were trained and tested with simulated incident data from an arterial network. Test results have shown that SVM offers a lower misclassification rate, higher correct detection rate, lower false alarm rate and slightly faster detection time than the multi-layer feed forward neural network (MLF) and probabilistic neural network models in arterial incident detection.

An ensemble learning model is a weighted combination of multiple classification models or week classifiers to form a strong classification model. The goal of ensemble learning is to combine decisions or predictions of several base classifiers to improve prediction, generalizability, and robustness over a single classifier. This paper employs the Boosting ensemble by growing individual decision trees sequentially and then assembling these trees to produce a powerful classification model. To improve the prediction accuracy of ridesplitting choices, we explored real-world individual level data extracted from the on-demand ride service platform of DiDi in Hangzhou, China. Over one million trips of the four service types, i.e., Taxi Hailing Service, Express, Private Car Service, and Hitch, are explored with descriptive statistics. A variety of features that may impact ridesplitting behavior are ranked and selected by using the ReliefF algorithm, such as trip travel time, trip costs, trip length, waiting time fee, travel time reliability of origins/destinations and so on. The Boosting ensemble trees with full features and selected features are trained and validated using two independent datasets. This paper also verifies that ensemble learning is particularly useful and powerful in the ridesplitting analysis and outperforms three other widely used classifiers. This paper is one of the first quantitative studies that empirically reveal the real-world demand and supply pattern by exploring the city-wide data of an on-demand ride service platform.}

As a result, such text components enclose considerable richness that is invaluable for incident analysis, modeling and prediction. However, the difficulty to formally interpret such data has led to minimal consideration in previous work. In this paper, we focus on the task of incident duration prediction, more specifically on predicting clearance time, the period between incident reporting and road clearance. An accurate prediction will help traffic operators implement appropriate mitigation measures and better inform drivers about expected road blockage time. The key contribution is the introduction of topic modeling, a text analysis technique, as a tool for extracting information from incident reports in real time. We analyze a dataset of 2years of accident cases and develop a machine learning based duration prediction model that integrates textual with non-textual features. To demonstrate the value of the approach, we compare predictions with and without text analysis using several different prediction models. Models using textual features consistently outperform the others in nearly all circumstances, presenting errors up to 28% lower than models without such information.}

With the rise of artificial intelligence, many recent studies attempted to use deep neural networks to extract comprehensive features from traffic networks to enhance prediction performance, given the volume and variety of traffic data has been greatly increased. Considering that traffic status on a road segment is highly influenced by the upstream/downstream segments and nearby bottlenecks in the traffic network, extracting well-localized features from these neighboring segments is essential for a traffic prediction model. Although the convolution neural network or graph convolution neural network has been adopted to learn localized features from the complex geometric or topological structure of traffic networks, the lack of flexibility in the local-feature extraction process is still a big issue. Classical wavelet transform can detect sudden changes and peaks in temporal signals. Analogously, when extending to the graph/spectral domain, graph wavelet can concentrate more on key vertices in the graph and discriminatively extract localized features. In this study, to capture the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in network-wide traffic data, we learn the traffic network as a graph and propose a graph wavelet gated recurrent (GWGR) neural network. The graph wavelet is incorporated as a key component for extracting spatial features in the proposed model. A gated recurrent structure is employed to learn temporal dependencies in the sequence data. Comparing to baseline models, the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance and training efficiency on two real-world datasets. In addition, experiments show that the sparsity of graph wavelet weight matrices greatly increases the interpretability of GWGR.}

In this research, an innovative methodological framework based on a data-driven approach is proposed for the estimation of car-following models, suitable for incorporation into microscopic traffic simulation models. An existing technique, i.e. locally weighted regression (loess), is defined through an optimization problem and is employed in a novel way. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using data collected from a sequence of instrumented vehicles in Naples, Italy. Gipps’ model, one of the most extensively used car-following models, is calibrated against the same data and used as a reference benchmark. Optimization issues are raised in both cases.

This study, therefore, examined the effects of emotional valence and arousal on drivers’ takeover timeliness and quality in conditionally automated driving. We conducted a driving simulation experiment with 32 participants. Movie clips were played for emotion induction. Participants with different levels of emotional valence and arousal were required to take over control from automated driving, and their takeover time and quality were analyzed. Results indicate that positive valence led to better takeover quality in the form of a smaller maximum resulting acceleration and a smaller maximum resulting jerk. However, high arousal did not yield an advantage in takeover time. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how emotional valence and arousal affect takeover performance. The benefits of positive emotions carry over from manual driving to conditionally automated driving while the benefits of arousal do not.}

abstract = {Vehicle flow forecasting is of crucial importance for the management of road traffic in complex urban networks, as well as a useful input for route planning algorithms. In general traffic predictive models rely on data gathered by different types of sensors placed on roads, which occasionally produce faulty readings due to several causes, such as malfunctioning hardware or transmission errors. Filling in those gaps is relevant for constructing accurate forecasting models, a task which is engaged by diverse strategies, from a simple null value imputation to complex spatio-temporal context imputation models. This work elaborates on two machine learning approaches to update missing data with no gap length restrictions: a spatial context sensing model based on the information provided by surrounding sensors, and an automated clustering analysis tool that seeks optimal pattern clusters in order to impute values. Their performance is assessed and compared to other common techniques and different missing data generation models over real data captured from the city of Madrid (Spain). The newly presented methods are found to be fairly superior when portions of missing data are large or very abundant, as occurs in most practical cases.}

Large-scale LPR systems have seen rapid development in many parts of the world. However, limited by privacy considerations, LPR data are seldom available to the research community, which lead to huge research gap in data-driven applications. In this study, we propose a complete solution using LPR data for link-based traffic state estimation and prediction for arterial networks. The proposed integrative data-driven framework provides the inference of both cycle maximum queue length states and average travel times of links using LPR data from a subset of intersections in an arterial network. The framework contains three novel data-driven sub-components that are highly customized based on the characteristics of LPR data, including: a traffic signal timing inference model to find signal timing information from the LPR timestamp sequences; a light-weighted queue length approximation model to estimate lane-based cycle maximum queue lengths and a network-wide traffic state inference model to perform network-level estimation and prediction using partially observed data. This study exploits and utilizes the unique features of LPR data and other similar vehicle re-identification data for urban network-wide link-based traffic state estimation and prediction. A six days’ LPR dataset from a small road network in the city of Langfang in China and a more comprehensive link-level field experiment dataset are used to validate the model. Numerical results show that the framework provides good estimation and prediction accuracy. The proposed framework is efficient and calibration-free, which can be easily implemented in urban networks for various real-time traffic monitoring and control applications.}

Although geo-location data has the potential to infer multi-day patterns of individual activities, appropriate methodological approaches are needed. This paper presents a technique to analyze large-scale geo-location data from social media to infer individual activity patterns. A data-driven modeling approach, based on topic modeling, is proposed to classify patterns in individual activity choices. The model provides an activity generation mechanism which when combined with the data from traditional surveys is potentially a useful component of an activity-travel simulator. Using the model, aggregate patterns of users’ weekly activities are extracted from the data. The model is extended to also find user-specific activity patterns. We extend the model to account for missing activities (a major limitation of social media data) and demonstrate how information from activity-based diaries can be complemented with longitudinal geo-location information. This work provides foundational tools that can be used when geo-location data is available to predict disaggregate activity patterns.}

Conventionally, vehicles are classified by size, the number of axles or engine types, e.g., standard passenger cars versus trucks. However, vehicle flow heterogeneity stems from many other aspects in general, e.g., ride-sourcing vehicles versus personal vehicles, human driven vehicles versus connected and automated vehicles. Provided with some observations of vehicular flow for each class in a large-scale transportation network, how to estimate the multi-class spatio-temporal vehicular flow, in terms of time-varying Origin-Destination (OD) demand and path/link flow, remains a big challenge. This paper presents a solution framework for multi-class dynamic OD demand estimation (MCDODE) in large-scale networks that work for any vehicular data in general. The proposed framework cast the standard OD estimation methods into a computational graph with tensor representations of spatio-temporal flow and all intermediate features involved in the MCDODE formulation. A forward-backward algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the MCDODE formulation on computational graphs. In addition, we propose a novel concept of tree-based cumulative curves to compute the exact multi-class Dynamic Assignment Ratio (DAR) matrix. A Growing Tree algorithm is developed to construct tree-based cumulative curves. The proposed framework is examined on a small network, a mid-size network as well as a real-world large-scale network. The experiment results indicate that the proposed framework is compelling, satisfactory and computationally plausible.}

In Japan, large-scale anomaly events such as traffic standstills that cause serious road disturbances occur frequently every year because of heavy snowfall. However, if the risk of anomaly events is known in advance, appropriate preparation and management can be undertaken to prevent such events and/or alleviate their impacts on road traffic. Therefore, this study attempts to evaluate the risk of standstills based on the degraded road performance estimated from probe vehicle speeds using sequential Bayesian filtering in a state space model (SSM). The SSM comprises a system model constructed by learning historical data and a measurement model using several exogenous variables such as snowfall amounts and temperature. The risk of anomaly events is then determined as the deviation of the filtered vehicle speed by the SSM from the statistically feasible speed distribution. The validation is performed by applying the proposed model to 58 traffic-standstill cases in northern Japan, and we confirm that the model successfully evaluates risks at a reasonable level that permits the practical use.}

Digital images from either ends (left and right) of the sleepers have been acquired. A pattern recognition approach has been adopted to classify the condition of the sleeper into classes (good or bad) and thereby achieve automation. Appropriate image analysis techniques were applied and relevant features such as the number of cracks on a sleeper, average length and width of the crack and the condition of the metal plate were determined. Feature fusion has been proposed in order to integrate the features obtained from each end for the classification task which follows. The effect of using classifiers like multi-layer perceptron and support vector machines has been tested and compared. Results obtained from the experiments show that multi-layer perceptron and support vector machines have achieved encouraging results, with a classification accuracy of 90%; thereby exhibiting a competitive performance when compared to a human operator.}

In the proposed approach, a novel use of risk-averse and hybrid prediction methodology controls the underestimation of defects. Then, a discounted Markov decision process model utilizes these predictions to determine optimal inspection and maintenance scheduling policies. Furthermore, in the presence of capacity constraints, Whittle indices via the multi-armed restless bandit formulation dynamically provide the optimal policies using the updated transition kernels. Results indicate a high accuracy rate in prediction and effective long-term scheduling policies that are adaptable to changing conditions.}

We examine four incremental learning methods using a damped window model namely, Multivariate multiple regression, Spherical-spherical regression, Randomized spherical K-NN regression and an Ensemble of these methods for their effectiveness in solving the destination prediction problem. The performance of these methods on several large datasets are evaluated using suitably chosen metrics and they were also compared with some other existing methods. We found that the Multivariate multiple regression method has the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy but the Spherical-spherical regression method is the best performer when we take into account the accuracy time trade-off criterion. The next pickup location problem, where we are interested in predicting the next pickup location for a taxi given the dropoff location coordinates of the previous trip as input is also considered and the aforementioned methods are examined for their suitability using real world datasets. As in the case of destination prediction problem, here also we find that the Multivariate multiple regression method gives better performance than the rest when we consider prediction accuracy but the Spherical-spherical regression method is the best performer when the accuracy-time trade-off criterion is taken into account.}

For building an efficient Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and shared-control systems, the vehicle needs to understand the drivers’ intent and their activities to generate assistant and collaborative control strategies. In this study, a driver intention inference system that focuses on the highway lane change maneuvers is proposed. First, a high-level driver intention mechanism and framework are introduced. Then, a vision-based intention inference system is proposed, which captures the multi-modal signals based on multiple low-cost cameras and the VBOX vehicle data acquisition system. A novel ensemble bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units is proposed to deal with the time-series driving sequence and the temporal behavioral patterns. Naturalistic highway driving data that consists of lane-keeping, left and right lane change maneuvers are collected and used for model construction and evaluation. Furthermore, the driver's pre-maneuver activities are statistically analyzed. It is found that for situation-aware, drivers usually check the mirrors for more than six seconds before they initiate the lane change maneuver, and the time interval between steering the handwheel and crossing the lane is about 2 s on average. Finally, hypothesis testing is conducted to show the significant improvement of the proposed algorithm over existing ones. With five-fold cross-validation, the EBiLSTM model achieves an average accuracy of 96.1% for the intention that is inferred 0.5 s before the maneuver starts.}

This paper proposes a novel method to infer the trip purpose attribute from the sequences of trips of passengers instead of separate trips. The proposed method infers the trip purpose attribute (a missing attribute in the smart card data) from the temporal attributes (available attributes in the smart card data). First, the relation between the temporal attributes and the trip purpose attribute is learnt by discovering clusters of passengers in the Household Travel Survey dataset while each passenger is represented by one sequence of trips. Then, the discovered clusters are utilized to infer the trip purpose of smart card transactions by allocating each passenger to the closest clusters. The proposed method is implemented on the smart card and HTS datasets from southeast Queensland, Australia. The evaluation results showed a considerable improvement in inferring the trip purpose compared to the results published in the literature. Notably, the effect of considering the trip sequence was more significant than considering land use variables.}

In early traffic forecasting studies, time-series models were adopted to accommodate autocorrelations between traffic states. The incorporation of spatial correlations into the forecasting of traffic states, however, involved a computational burden. Deep learning technologies were recently introduced to traffic forecasting in order to accommodate the spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states. In the present study, we devised a novel graph-based neural network that expanded the existing graph convolutional neural network (GCN). The proposed model allowed us to differentiate the intensity of connecting to neighbor roads, unlike existing GCNs that give equal weight to each neighbor road. A plausible model architecture that mimicked real traffic propagation was established based on the graph convolution. The domain knowledge was efficiently incorporated into a neural network architecture. The present study also employed a generative adversarial framework to ensure that a forecasted traffic state could be as realistic as possible considering the joint probabilistic density of real traffic states. The forecasting performance of the proposed model surpassed that of the original GCN model, and the estimated adjacency matrices revealed the hidden nature of real traffic propagation.}

Yet, precisely estimating future flow rates is a challenge for traffic managers during daily operations as capacity depends on a number of factors/decisions with very dynamic and uncertain profiles. This paper presents a data-driven framework for AAR prediction and planning towards improved traffic flow management decision support. A unique feature of this framework is to account for operational interdependency aspects that exist in metroplex systems and affect throughput performance. Gaussian Process regression is used to create an airport capacity prediction model capable of translating weather and metroplex configuration forecasts into probabilistic arrival capacity forecasts for strategic time horizons. To process the capacity forecasts and assist the design of traffic flow management strategies, an optimization model for capacity allocation is developed. The proposed models are found to outperform currently used methods in predicting throughput performance at the New York airports. Moreover, when used to prescribe optimal AARs in GDPs, an overall delay reduction of up to 9.7% is achieved. The results also reveal that incorporating robustness in the design of the traffic flow management plan can contribute to decrease delay costs while increasing predictability.}

In this paper, a novel end to end deep learning framework is proposed to estimate and predict the spatiotemporal patterns of transportation resilience under extreme weather events. Diffusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and a dynamic-capturing algorithm of transportation resilience jointly form the backbone of this framework. The presented framework can capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of urban road network and evaluate transportation resilience based on real-world big data, including on-demand ride services data provided by DiDi Chuxing and grid meteorological data. Results show that aggregate data of related precipitation events could be used for transportation resilience modeling under extreme weather events when facing sample imbalance problem due to limited historical disaster data. In terms of observed transportation resilience, transportation network demonstrates different characteristics between sparse network and dense network, as well as general precipitation events and extreme weather events. The response time is double or triple of the recovery time, and an elastic limit exists in the recovery process of network resilience. In terms of resilience prediction, the proposed model outperforms competitors by incorporating topological information and has better predictions of the system performance degradation than other resilience indices. The above results could assist researchers and policy makers clearly understand the real-world resilience of urban road networks in both theory and practice, and take effective responses under emergent disruptive events.}

Adaptive traffic signal control as the principle part of intelligent transportation systems has a primary role to effectively reduce traffic congestion by making a real-time adaptation in response to the changing traffic network dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective approach in machine learning that has been applied for designing adaptive traffic signal controllers. One of the most efficient and robust type of RL algorithms are continuous state actor-critic algorithms that have the advantage of fast learning and the ability to generalize to new and unseen traffic conditions. These algorithms are utilized in this paper to design adaptive traffic signal controllers called actor-critic adaptive traffic signal controllers (A-CATs controllers). The contribution of the present work rests on the integration of three threads: (a) showing performance comparisons of both discrete and continuous A-CATs controllers in a traffic network with recurring congestion (24-h traffic demand) in the upper downtown core of Tehran city, (b) analyzing the effects of different traffic disruptions including opportunistic pedestrians crossing, parking lane, non-recurring congestion, and different levels of sensor noise on the performance of A-CATS controllers, and (c) comparing the performance of different function approximators (tile coding and radial basis function) on the learning of A-CATs controllers. To this end, first an agent-based traffic simulation of the study area is carried out. Then six different scenarios are conducted to find the best A-CATs controller that is robust enough against different traffic disruptions. We observe that the A-CATs controller based on radial basis function networks (RBF (5)) outperforms others. This controller is benchmarked against controllers of discrete state Q-learning, Bayesian Q-learning, fixed time and actuated controllers; and the results reveal that it consistently outperforms them.}

Indeed, safe, accessible, and sustainable transport systems in cities are a core target of the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Thus, there is an opportunity to apply advanced computational tools to the problem of traffic safety, in regards especially to pedestrians, who have been often overlooked in the past. This paper combines public data sources, large-scale street imagery and computer vision techniques to approach pedestrian and vehicle safety with an automated, relatively simple, and universally-applicable data-processing scheme. The steps involved in this pipeline include the adaptation and training of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network to determine a hazard index for each given urban scene, as well as an interpretability analysis based on image segmentation and class activation mapping on those same images. Combined, the outcome of this computational approach is a fine-grained map of hazard levels across a city, and an heuristic to identify interventions that might simultaneously improve pedestrian and vehicle safety. The proposed framework should be taken as a complement to the work of urban planners and public authorities.}

In this paper, we aim to bridge between psychological, social marketing and ICT research in the field of transportation. We explore how attitude based segments are reflected in high resolution mobility behaviour data, crowdsourced via mobile phones. We use support vector machines to map eight attitudinal segments, as defined under the European project SEGMENT, to the n dimensional space defined by crowdsourced data. The success rate of the proposed approach is 98.9%. This demonstrates the applicability of the method as a way to automatically map attitudinal segments to a wider population based on observed mobility data instead of using explicit attitudinal surveys. In addition, the proposed approach can facilitate the delivery of personalised target messages to individuals (e.g. via smartphones) or at target locations where users, belonging to specific segment, are located at specific time windows since the data includes the time-space indications.}

abstract = {Traffic accidents constitute a major problem worldwide. One of the principal causes of traffic accidents is adverse driving behavior that is inherently influenced by traffic conditions and infrastructure among other parameters. Probabilistic models for the assessment of road accidents risk usually employs machine learning using historical data of accident records. The main drawback of these approaches is limited coverage of traffic data. This study illustrates a prototype approach that escapes from this problem, and highlights the need to enhance historical accident records with traffic information for improved road safety analysis. Traffic conditions estimation is achieved through Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) simulation that utilizes temporal aspects of a transportation system. Accident risk quantification is achieved through a Bayesian Networks (BNs) model learned from the method’s enriched accidents dataset. The study illustrates the integration of BN with the DTA-based simulator, Visual Interactive Systems for Transport Algorithms (VISTAs), for the assessment of accident risk index (ARI), used to identify accident black spots on road networks.}

The data used in the assessment often come from the real flights, while the traditional land-based ADS-B equipment has limited coverage and cannot be used for research. The space-based ADS-B system can receive and send the flight position of the aircraft over the ocean area. In this paper, the ocean tracks in space-based ADS-B data are first extracted. According to the different route structures, the data of fixed route and flexible route are preprocessed by segmented Kalman filter and cubic polynomial fitting method respectively. Then the processed track position error is calculated, and Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) median method is used to test the normal distribution of the error, and k-means clustering is used to obtain the clustering center and occurrence frequency of positioning error and flight error. Finally, a collision risk model based on Bayesian network is established, and the error distribution parameters and occurrence frequency are brought into the model to evaluate the collision risk of parallel routes in the ocean area. The results show that the lateral collision risk based on space-based ADS-B ocean flight data is lower than 0.5 × 10−8 times/hour specified by ICAO when the fixed route separation is 14n miles and the flexible route separation is 49n miles. And the actual lateral interval of the Pacific flexible route is 50n miles (Jiang, 2010), which meets the safety target level.}

It is a fundamental problem in the modeling of transportation where the synthetic populations of micro-agents represent a key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological framework for how to ‘grow’ pools of micro-agents is presented. The model framework adopts a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Compared to the previous population synthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs sampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden Markov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution for high dimensions. The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional Gibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by using a large-scale Danish trip diary. It is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE in the low-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number of modeled attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler essentially replicates the agents from the original sample when the required conditional distributions are estimated as frequency tables. In contrast, the VAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents that are virtually different from those in the original data but have similar statistical properties. The presented approach can support agent-based modeling at all levels by enabling richer synthetic populations with smaller zones and more detailed individual characteristics.}

From traffic monitoring at the city scale, to commuters in train terminals, recent progress in sensing technology make it possible to use cameras to better understand the demand, i.e., better track moving agents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians). Whether the cameras are mounted on drones, vehicles, or fixed in the built environments, they inevitably remain scatter. We need to develop the technology to re-identify the same agents across images captured from non-overlapping field-of-views, referred to as the visual re-identification task. State-of-the-art methods learn a neural network based representation trained with the cross-entropy loss function. We argue that such loss function is not suited for the visual re-identification task hence propose to model confidence in the representation learning framework. We show the impact of our confidence-based learning framework with three methods: label smoothing, confidence penalty, and deep variational information bottleneck. They all show a boost in performance validating our claim. Our contribution is generic to any agent of interest, i.e., vehicles or pedestrians, and outperform highly specialized state-of-the-art methods across 6 datasets. The source code and models are shared towards an open science mission.}

The proposed algorithms are able to take advantage of the strengthens of topological relation judgment and the semi-supervised learning technique by optimizing the selection of pre-labeling samples and initial clustering centers of the original semi-supervised learning technique based on horizontal Global Positioning System data. The proposed algorithms were validated and evaluated based on the probe vehicle data collected at two mixed corridors on Shanghai’s urban expressways. Results indicate that the enhanced SFCM algorithm could achieve the best performance in terms of clustering purity and Normalized Mutual Information, followed by the CKM algorithm and the SKM algorithm. It may reach a nearly 100% clustering purity for the uncongested conditions and a clustering purity greater than 80% for the congested conditions. Meanwhile, it could improve clustering purity averagely by 21% and 14% for the congested conditions and 6.5% and 6% for the uncongested conditions, as compared with the traditional K-Means algorithm and the basic SFCM. The proposed algorithms can be applied for both on-line and off-line purposes, without the need of historical data. Clustering accuracies under different traffic conditions and possible improvements with the use of historical data are also discussed.}

This method can efficiently represent and compute the complex stochastic inference between random variables. Moreover, it allows updating the probability distributions and reducing the uncertainty of future train delays in real time under the assumption that more information continuously becomes available from the monitoring system. The dynamics of a train delay over time and space is presented as a stochastic process that describes the evolution of the time-dependent random variable. This approach is further extended by modelling the interdependence between trains that share the same infrastructure or have a scheduled passenger transfer. The model is applied on a set of historical traffic realisation data from the part of a busy corridor in Sweden. We present the results and analyse the accuracy of predictions as well as the evolution of probability distributions of event delays over time. The presented method is important for making better predictions for train traffic, that are not only based on static, offline collected data, but are able to positively include the dynamic characteristics of the continuously changing delays.}

We propose two deep learning models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with self-attention mechanism—namely, hybrid LSTM and sequential LSTM. These models capture patterns in location and time sequences in trajectory data and their dependencies to predict next locations and travel times simultaneously. Using Bluetooth vehicle trajectory data from Brisbane, Australia, we compare the prediction performance of the proposed models with several existing approaches including hidden Markov model and other LSTM-based models. The results show that the proposed models produce higher prediction accuracy for both location and time prediction tasks, with the sequential LSTM yielding the best performance. Compared to the conventional next location prediction problem, which considers location sequences only without travel time consideration, the study finds that jointly modelling location and travel time sequences actually improves the next location prediction performance itself, potentially because travel time observations capture the information on traffic conditions in the network, which may affect drivers’ location choices. We demonstrate an application of the proposed models in network traffic management, where important locations can be identified to mitigate congestion in a hot-spot by predicting where vehicles come from and go next in an urban road network.}

Perhaps the biggest one lies in choice of the appropriate kernel function for the practical problem; how to optimize the parameters efficiently and effectively presents another one. Unfortunately, these limitations are still research topics in current literature. This paper puts an effort to investigate these limitations. In order to find the effective way to choose the appropriate and suitable kernel function, this paper constructs a new kernel function using a wavelet function to capture the non-stationary characteristics of the short-term traffic speed data. In order to find the efficient way to identify the model structure parameters, this paper uses the Phase Space Reconstruction theory to identify the input space dimension. To take the advantage of these components, the paper proposes a short-term traffic speed forecasting hybrid model (Chaos–Wavelet Analysis-Support Vector Machine model, referred to as C-WSVM model in this paper). The real traffic speed data is applied to evaluate the performance and practicality of the model and the results are encouraging. The theoretical advantage and better performance from the study indicate that the C-WSVM model has good potential to be developed and is feasible for short-term traffic speed forecasting study.}

This paper presents a flexible framework to automatically extract these interaction patterns from observed temporal sequences based on driving primitives. A Bayesian nonparametric approach is developed to segment vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) sequential observations into small analytically interpretable components (called driving primitives) without using prior knowledge. Then, an unsupervised clustering method is developed to gather these driving primitives into groups (called driving patterns) by integrating with dynamic time warping. In addition, the extracted driving primitives are used to quantitatively analyze the similarities between behaviors at different intersections using a relative entropy metric, i.e., KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence. Finally, 706 naturalistic V2V events from eight typical urban signalized intersections are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed primitive-based framework. Experimental results demonstrate that there exist 15 types of interactive driving patterns for V2V behaviors at intersections in our database. Moreover, the distribution of interactive driving patterns could characterize the types of intersections.}

Furthermore, four types of GCNN models are proposed whose adjacency matrices are based on various bike-sharing system data, including Spatial Distance matrix (SD), Demand matrix (DE), Average Trip Duration matrix (ATD), and Demand Correlation matrix (DC). These six types of GCNN models and seven other benchmark models are built and compared on a Citi Bike dataset from New York City which includes 272 stations and over 28 million transactions from 2013 to 2016. Results show that the GCNNrec-DDGF performs the best in terms of the Root Mean Square Error, the Mean Absolute Error and the coefficient of determination (R2), followed by the GCNNreg-DDGF. They outperform the other models. Through a more detailed graph network analysis based on the learned DDGF, insights are obtained on the “black box” of the GCNN-DDGF model. It is found to capture some information similar to details embedded in the SD, DE and DC matrices. More importantly, it also uncovers hidden heterogeneous pairwise correlations between stations that are not revealed by any of those matrices.}

This paper presents a framework for real-time risk assessment on a freeway in Colorado by fusing data from two different detection systems (AVI and RTMS), real-time weather and roadway geometry. Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB), a relatively recent and promising machine learning technique is used to calibrate the models. SGB’s key strengths lie in its capability to fit complex nonlinear relationships, handling different types of predictors (nominal and categorical) and accommodating missing values with no need for prior transformation of the predictor variables or elimination of outliers. Boosting multiple simple trees together overcomes the drawback of single tree models of poor prediction accuracy and provides fast and superior predictive performance. The proposed framework is considered a good alternative for real-time risk assessment on freeways because of its high estimation accuracy, robustness and reliability.}

This in turn results in inefficient use of airline resources such as aircraft, crew, and ground personnel. Taxi-out time prediction is also a first step in enabling schedule modifications that would help mitigate congestion and reduce emissions. The dynamically changing operation at the airport makes it difficult to accurately predict taxi-out time. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of taxi out time prediction using a nonparametric reinforcement learning (RL) based method, set in the probabilistic framework of stochastic dynamic programming. A case-study of Tampa International Airport (TPA) shows that on an average, with 93.7% probability, on any given day, our predicted mean taxi-out time for any given quarter, matches the actual mean taxi-out time for the same quarter with a standard error of 1.5min. Also, for individual flights, the taxi-out time of 81% of them were predicted accurately within a standard error of 2min. The predictions were done 15min before gate departure. Gate OUT, wheels OFF, wheels ON, and gate IN (OOOI) data available in the Aviation System Performance Metric (ASPM) database maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was used to model and analyze the problem.

Through Basic Safety Message (BSM) data from the Michigan Safety Pilot Program, this study applies a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to understand driving behavior in terms of acceleration, deceleration and maintaining speed decisions. Personally Revealed Choices (PRC) that maximize the expected sum of rewards for individual drivers are obtained by analyzing detailed data from 120 trips and the application of MDP. Specifically, this paper defines states based on the number of objects around the host vehicle and the distance to the front object. Given the states, individual drivers’ reward functions are estimated using the multinomial logit model and used in the MDP framework. Optimal policies (i.e. PRC) are obtained through a value iteration algorithm. The results show that as the number of objects increases around a host vehicle, the driver prefer to accelerate in order to escape the crowdedness around them. In addition, when trips are segmented based on the level of crowdedness, increased levels of trip crowdedness results in a fewer number of drivers accelerating because the traffic conditions constrain them to maintaining constant speed or deceleration. One potential application of this study is to generate short-term predictive driver decision information through historical driving performance, which can be used to warn a host vehicle driver when the person substantially deviates from their own historical PRC. This information could also be disseminated to surrounding vehicles as well, enabling them to foresee the states and actions of other drivers and potentially avoid collisions.}

abstract = {Traffic status detection on arterial roads is challenging because of the complexity of urban traffic and the limited coverage and high deployment cost of traffic detectors. Ubiquitous mobile phones and data generated from the events of these mobile devices provide a promising approach for traffic status detection. This paper proposes a novel approach solely using cellular event data without the cellphone GPS information to detect traffic status on arterial roads. Different from the conventional methods, the proposed approach uses features derived only from cellular data to estimate traffic status, not requiring any cellphone location information. Both handoff (HO) and location update (LU) events generated at each cellular station were extracted from the original data to form a candidate feature set. A feature selection method based on joint mutual information (JMI) was used to select features to cover the maximum information, which can resolve issues such as loss of useful information caused by conventional feature selection techniques. A support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was then employed to model the relationship between the selected features and traffic status (low, medium, and high-traffic). Finally, the proposed method was validated by both a field experiment in Taicang, China with 1-hour-time-interval samples and a simulation experiment on VISSIM with 5-minute-time-interval samples. This study provides a new perspective for traffic status detection which may help design strategies for traffic management and route navigation to improve traveling efficiency, especially for the cities lack of traffic surveillance devices.}

abstract = {Short-term traffic forecasting based on deep learning methods, especially recurrent neural networks (RNN), has received much attention in recent years. However, the potential of RNN-based models in traffic forecasting has not yet been fully exploited in terms of the predictive power of spatial–temporal data and the capability of handling missing data. In this paper, we focus on RNN-based models and attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate RNN and its variants into traffic prediction models. A stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM network architecture (SBU-LSTM) is proposed to assist the design of neural network structures for traffic state forecasting. As a key component of the architecture, the bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) is exploited to capture the forward and backward temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data. To deal with missing values in spatial–temporal data, we also propose a data imputation mechanism in the LSTM structure (LSTM-I) by designing an imputation unit to infer missing values and assist traffic prediction. The bidirectional version of LSTM-I is incorporated in the SBU-LSTM architecture. Two real-world network-wide traffic state datasets are used to conduct experiments and published to facilitate further traffic prediction research. The prediction performance of multiple types of multi-layer LSTM or BDLSTM models is evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM architecture, especially the two-layer BDLSTM network, can achieve superior performance for the network-wide traffic prediction in both accuracy and robustness. Further, comprehensive comparison results show that the proposed data imputation mechanism in the RNN-based models can achieve outstanding prediction performance when the model’s input data contains different patterns of missing values.}

Image data are collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and microscopic characteristics such as vehicle type, position, velocity, and trajectory are extracted through computer vision techniques. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier are utilized for the vehicle detection, while the Kalman Filter is employed for the derivation of vehicle trajectories. The Safety Space is then determined based on those trajectories. Validation data are collected at intersections in Taipei, Taiwan; Bangkok, Thailand; and Mumbai, India. The vehicle detection and tracking are satisfactory, and the Safety Space surrogate reveals risk zones caused by spatial proximity between vehicles.}

The primary focus of this article is to critically analyse the current literature on essential steps involved in the tOD estimation process. The steps include processes of data cleansing, estimation of unknowns, transfer detection, validation of developed algorithms, and ultimately estimation of zone level transit OD (ztOD). Estimation of unknowns includes boarding and alighting information estimation of passengers. Transfer detection algorithms distinguish between a transfer or an activity between two consecutive boarding and alighting.

Among these systems, fully-adaptive ones are required to adapt their behaviour not only to traffic conditions but also to drivers’ preferences and attitudes, as well as to the way such preferences change for the same driver in different driving sessions. This would ideally lead towards a system where an on-board electronic control unit can be asked by the driver to calibrate its own parameters while he/she manually drives for a few minutes (learning mode). After calibration, the control unit switches to the running mode where the learned driving style is applied. The learning mode can be activated by any driver of the car, for any driving session and each time he/she wishes to change the current driving behaviour of the cruise control system. The modelling framework which we propose to implement comprises four layers (sampler, profiler, tutor, performer). The sampler is responsible for human likeness and can be calibrated while in learning mode. Then, while in running mode, it works together with the other modelling layers to implement the logic. This paper presents the overall framework, with particular emphasis on the sampler and the profiler that are explained in full mathematical detail. Specification and calibration of the proposed framework are supported by the observed data, collected by means of an instrumented vehicle. The data are also used to assess the proposed framework, confirming human-like and fully-adaptive characteristics.}

Several methods, which include support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), k nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) and linear regression (LR), are adopted for the bus arrival time prediction. Observation surveys are conducted to collect bus running and arrival time data for validation of the proposed models.

For highway traffic monitoring, probe vehicle data is one of the most promising data source. However, since such data do not always cover an entire study area, we cannot measure traffic speeds on all links in a time-dependent manner; quite a few links are unobserved. To continuously monitor speeds on all links, it is necessary to develop a technique that estimates speeds on unobserved links from historical observed link speeds. For this purpose, we extend the current Gaussian graphical model so as to use two or more multivariate normal distributions to accurately estimate unobserved link speeds. In general, since the number of unknown model parameters (mean parameters and covariance matrices) is enormous and also unobserved links always exist, the EM algorithm and the graphical lasso technique are employed to determine the model parameters. Our proposed model was applied to the Bangkok city center in Thailand as well as to the Fujisawa city in Japan. We confirmed that the model can estimate the unobserved link speeds quite reasonably.}

Leveraging spatial–temporal data from multiple sources for (citywide) traffic forecasting is a key to strengthen the smart city management in areas such as urban traffic control, abnormal event detection, etc. Existing approaches of traffic flow prediction mainly rely on the development of various deep neural networks –e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks such as ResNet are used for modeling spatial dependencies among different regions, whereas recurrent neural networks are increasingly implemented for temporal dynamics modeling. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches suffer from limitations of intensive computations, lack of capabilities to properly deal with missing values, and simplistic integration of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel urban flow prediction framework by generalizing the hidden states of the model with continuous-time dynamics of the latent states using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we introduce a discretize-then-optimize approach to improve and balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. It not only guarantees the prediction error but also provides high flexibility for decision-makers. Furthermore, we investigate the factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that affect the city traffic volume and use separate neural networks to extract and disentangle the influencing factors, which avoids the brute-force data fusion in previous works. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, while requiring significantly less memory cost and fewer model parameters.}

abstract = {Population synthesis is concerned with the generation of agents for agent-based modelling in many fields, such as economics, transportation, ecology and epidemiology. When the number of attributes describing the agents and/or their level of detail becomes large, survey data cannot densely support the joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of dimensionality. It leads to a situation where many attribute combinations are missing from the sample data while such combinations exist in the real population. In this case, it becomes essential to consider methods that are able to impute such missing information effectively. In this paper, we propose to use deep generative latent models. These models are able to learn a compressed representation of the data space, which when projected back to the original space, leads to an effective way of imputing information in the observed data space. Specifically, we employ the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for a large-scale population synthesis application. The models are applied to a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more than 60 variables and trained and tested using cross-validation. A new metric that applies to the evaluation of generative models in an unsupervised setting is proposed. It is based on the ability to generate diverse yet valid synthetic attribute combinations by comparing if the models can recover missing combinations (sampling zeros) while keeping truly impossible combinations (structural zeros) models at a minimum. For a low-dimensional experiment, the VAE, the marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5%, 21% and 26% more structural zeros per sampling zero when compared to the WGAN. For a high dimensional case, these figures increase to 44%, 2217% and 170440% respectively. This research directly supports the development of agent-based systems and in particular cases where detailed socio-economic or geographical representations are required.}

On the downside, smartphones have inherent limitations such as relatively limited energy capacity, processing power, and accuracy. These shortcomings may potentially limit their role as an integrated platform for monitoring driver behaviour in the context of ITS. This study examines this hypothesis by reviewing recent scientific contributions. The Cybernetics theoretical framework was employed to allow a systematic comparison. First, only a few studies consider the smartphone as an integrated platform. Second, a lack of consistency between the approaches and metrics used in the literature is noted. Last but not least, areas such as fusion of heterogeneous information sources, Deep Learning and sparse crowd-sensing are identified as relatively unexplored, and future research in these directions is suggested.}

Two network-based machine learning models, a Bayesian network and a neural network, are formulated with a double star framework that reflects time and space correlation among traffic variables and because of its modular structure is suitable for an automatic implementation on large road networks. Among different mono-dimensional time-series models, a seasonal autoregressive moving average model (SARMA) is selected for comparison. The time-series model is also used in a hybrid modeling framework to provide the Bayesian network with an a priori estimation of the predicted speed, which is then corrected exploiting the information collected on other links. A large floating car data set on a sub-area of the road network of Rome is used for validation. To account for the variable accuracy of the speed estimated from floating car data, a new error indicator is introduced that relates accuracy of prediction to accuracy of measure. Validation results highlighted that the spatial architecture of the Bayesian network is advantageous in standard conditions, where a priori knowledge is more significant, while mono-dimensional time series revealed to be more valuable in the few cases of non-recurrent congestion conditions observed in the data set. The results obtained suggested introducing a supervisor framework that selects the most suitable prediction depending on the detected traffic regimes.}

There is an emerging trend of using reinforcement learning methods for VSL control. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to develop autonomous control agents for problems that were previously intractable. In this paper, a more effective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is developed for differential variable speed limit (DVSL) control, in which dynamic and distinct speed limits among lanes can be imposed. The proposed DRL model uses a novel actor-critic architecture to learn a large number of discrete speed limits in a continuous action space. Different reward signals, such as total travel time, bottleneck speed, emergency braking, and vehicular emissions are used to train the DVSL controller, and a comparison between these reward signals is conducted. The proposed DRL-based DVSL controllers are tested on a freeway with a simulated recurrent bottleneck. The simulation results show that the DRL based DVSL control strategy is able to improve the safety, efficiency and environment-friendliness of the freeway. In order to verify whether the controller generalizes to real world implementation, we also evaluate the generalization of the controllers on environments with different driving behavior attributes. and the robustness of the DRL agent is observed from the results.}

One fuel-saving opportunity for airlines is the possibility of reducing discretionary fuel loading by dispatchers. In this study, we propose a novel discretionary fuel estimation approach that can assist dispatchers with better discretionary fuel loading decisions. Based on the analysis on our study airline, our approach is found to substantially reduce unnecessary discretionary fuel loading while maintaining the same safety level compared to the current fuel loading practice. The idea is that by providing dispatchers with more accurate information and better recommendations derived from flight records, unnecessary fuel loading and corresponding cost-to-carry could both be reduced. We apply ensemble learning techniques to improve fuel burn prediction and construct prediction intervals (PIs) to capture the uncertainty of model predictions. The upper bound of a PI can then be used for discretionary fuel loading. The potential benefit of this approach is estimated to be $61.5 million in fuel savings and 428 million kg of CO2 reduction per year for our study airline. This study also builds a link between discretionary fuel estimation and aviation system predictability in which the proposed models can also be used to predict benefits from reduced fuel loading enabled by improved Air Traffic Management (ATM) targeting on improved system predictability.}

Different from the previous studies, the PSO-ELM models require no statistical inference nor distribution assumption of the model parameters, but rather focus on generating the prediction intervals (PIs) that can minimize a multi-objective function which considers two criteria, reliability and interval sharpness. The improved PSO-ELM models are developed for an hourly border crossing traffic dataset and compared to: (1) the original PSO-ELMs; (2) two state of the art models proposed by Zhang et al. (2014) and Guo et al. (2014) separately; and (3) the traditional ARMA and Kalman filter models. The results show that the improved PSO-ELM can always keep the mean PI length the lowest, and guarantee that the PI coverage probability is higher than the corresponding PI nominal confidence, regardless of the confidence level assumed. The study also probes the reasons that led to a few points being not covered by the PIs of PSO-ELMs. Finally, the study proposes a comprehensive optimization framework to make staffing plans for border crossing authority based on bounds of PIs and point predictions. The results show that for holidays, the staffing plans based on PI upper bounds generated much lower total system costs, and that those plans derived from PI upper bounds of the improved PSO-ELM models, are capable of producing the lowest average waiting times at the border. For a weekday or a typical Monday, the workforce plans based on point predictions from Zhang et al. (2014) and Guo et al. (2014) models generated the smallest system costs with low border crossing delays. Moreover, for both holiday and normal Monday scenarios, if the border crossing authority lacked the required staff to implement the plans based on PI upper bounds or point predictions, the staffing plans based on PI lower bounds from the improved PSO-ELMs performed the best, with an acceptable level of service and total system costs close to the point prediction plans.}

First, after a principal component analysis, observation days of a historical dataset are clustered. Two different methods are compared: a Gaussian Mixture Model and a k-means algorithm. The clustering results reveal that congestion maps of days of the same group have substantial similarity in their traffic conditions and dynamic. Such a map is a binary visualization of the congestion propagation on the freeway, giving more importance to the traffic dynamics. Second, a consensus day is identified in each cluster as the most representative day of the community according to the congestion maps. Third, this information obtained from the historical data is used to predict traffic congestion propagation and travel times. Thus, the first measurements of a new day are used to determine which consensual day is the closest to this new day. The past observations recorded for that consensual day are then used to predict future traffic conditions and travel times. This method is tested using ten months of data collected on a French freeway and shows very encouraging results.}

abstract = {Accurate short-term arrival forecasting is essential information for railway operators to conduct daily operations such as demand management strategies. Conventional time series methods apply historical arrival data which is the accumulation of reservations to project future arrivals. This study aims to utilize reservation data directly and proposes a novel advanced booking model by using the framework of case-based reasoning. The proposed model contains four modules with distinctive functions for similarity evaluation, instance selection, arrival projection, and parameter search. We have the constructed model tested on fourteen daily arrival series and compared its out-of-sample accuracy with that of four traditional benchmarks. The empirical results show that in average the proposed self-learning model may reduce at least 11% of mean square errors (MSE). Moreover, the learning scheme in the model may achieve significant reduction of MSE comparing with performance of other naïve versions.}

Traditional vehicle classification methods are either too expensive to be deployed for large areas or subject to errors under specific situations. In this paper, we propose methods to classify vehicles using GPS data extracted from mobile traffic sensors, which is considered to be low-cost especially for large areas of urban arterials. It is found that features related to the variations of accelerations and decelerations (e.g., the proportions of accelerations and decelerations larger than 1meter per square second, and the standard deviations of accelerations and decelerations) are the most effective in terms of vehicle classification using GPS data. By classifying general trucks from passenger cars, the average misclassification rate is about 1.6% for the training data, and 4.2% for the testing data.}

abstract = {Driver’s stop-or-run behavior at signalized intersection has become a major concern for the intersection safety. While many studies were undertaken to model and predict drivers’ stop-or-run (SoR) behaviors including Yellow-Light-Running (YLR) and Red-Light-Running (RLR) using traditional statistical regression models, a critical problem for these models is that the relative influences of predictor variables on driver’s SoR behavior could not be evaluated. To address this challenge, this research proposes a new approach which applies a recently developed data mining approach called gradient boosting logit model to handle different types of predictor variables, fit complex nonlinear relationships among variables, and automatically disentangle interaction effects between influential factors using high-resolution traffic and signal event data collected from loop detectors. Particularly, this research will first identify a series of related influential factors including signal timing information, surrounding traffic information, and surrounding drivers’ behaviors using thousands drivers’ decision events including YLR, RLR, and first-to-stop (FSTP) extracted from high-resolution loop detector data from three intersections. Then the research applies the proposed data mining approach to search for the optimal prediction model for each intersection. Furthermore, a comparison was conducted to compare the proposed new method with the traditional statistical regression model. The results show that the gradient boosting logit model has superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy. In contrast to other machine learning methods which usually apply ‘black-box’ procedures, the gradient boosting logit model can identify and rank the relative importance of influential factors on driver’s stop-or-run behavior prediction. This study brings great potential for future practical applications since loops have been widely implemented in many intersections and can collect data in real time. This research is expected to contribute to the improvement of intersection safety significantly.}

The task of detecting driving cycles (driving or car-mode trajectory segments) from wearable GPS data has been the subject of much research. Specifically, distinguishing driving cycles from other motorized trips (such as taking a bus) is the main research problem in this paper. Many mode detection methods only focus on raw GPS speed data while some studies apply additional information, such as geographic information system (GIS) data, to obtain better detection performance. Procuring and maintaining dedicated road GIS data are costly and not trivial, whereas the technical maturity and broad use of map service application program interface (API) queries offers opportunities for mode detection tasks. The proposed driving cycle detection method takes advantage of map service APIs to obtain high-quality car-mode API route information and uses a trajectory segmentation algorithm to find the best-matched API route. The car-mode API route data combined with the actual route information, including the actual mode information, are used to train a logistic regression machine learning model, which estimates car modes and non-car modes with probability rates. The experimental results show promise for the proposed method’s ability to detect vehicle mode accurately.}

It is one of the most critical tasks in high-speed passenger rail planning, operational decision-making and dynamic operation adjustment. An accurate short-term HSR demand prediction provides a basis for effective rail revenue management. In this paper, a hybrid short-term demand forecasting approach is developed by combining the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and grey support vector machine (GSVM) models. There are three steps in this hybrid forecasting approach: (i) decompose short-term passenger flow data with noises into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a trend term; (ii) predict each IMF using GSVM calibrated by the particle swarm optimization (PSO); (iii) reconstruct the refined IMF components to produce the final predicted daily HSR passenger flow, where the PSO is also applied to achieve the optimal refactoring combination. This innovative hybrid approach is demonstrated with three typical origin–destination pairs along the Wuhan-Guangzhou HSR in China. Mean absolute percentage errors of the EEMD-GSVM predictions using testing sets are 6.7%, 5.1% and 6.5%, respectively, which are much lower than those of two existing forecasting approaches (support vector machine and autoregressive integrated moving average). Application results indicate that the proposed hybrid forecasting approach performs well in terms of prediction accuracy and is especially suitable for short-term HSR passenger flow forecasting.}

abstract = {The fundamental challenge of the origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation problem is that it is severely under-determined. In this paper we propose a new data driven OD estimation method for cases where a supply pattern in the form of speeds and flows is available. We show that with these input data, we do not require an iterative dynamic network loading procedure that results in an equilibrium assignment, nor do we need an assumption on the kind of equilibrium that emerges from this process. The minimal number of ingredients which are needed are (a) a method to estimate/predict production and attraction time series; (b) a method to compute the N shortest paths from each OD zone to the next; and (c) two—possibly OD-specific—assumptions on the magnitude of N; and on the proportionality of path flows between these origins and destinations, respectively. The latter constitutes the most important behavioral assumption in our method, which relates to how we assume travelers have chosen their routes between OD pairs. We choose a proportionality factor that is inversely proportional to realized travel time, where we incorporate a penalty for path overlap. For large networks, these ingredients may be insufficient to solve the resulting system of equations. We show how additional constraints can be derived directly from the data by using principal component analysis, with which we exploit the fact that temporal patterns of production and attraction are similar across the network. Experimental results on a toy network and a large city network (Santander, Spain) show that our OD estimation method works satisfactorily, given a reasonable choice of N, and the use of so-called 3D supply patterns, which provide a compact representation of the supply dynamics over the entire network. Inclusion of topological information makes the method scalable both in terms of network size and for different topologies. Although we use a neural network to predict production and attraction in our experiments (which implies ground-truth OD data were needed), there are straight-forward paths to improve the method using additional data, such as demographic data, household survey data, social media and or movement traces, which could support estimating such ground-truth baseline production and attraction patterns. The proposed framework would fit very nicely in an online traffic modeling and control framework, and we see many paths to further refine and improve the method.}

In this paper, we propose the Multiple Spatio-Temporal Information Fusion Networks (MSTIF-Net), a novel deep learning approach to better fuse multiple situation awareness information and graphs representation. MSTIF-Net model integrates structures of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Sequence to Sequence Learning (Seq2seq) model to obtain the joint latent representation of urban ride-hailing situation that contain both Euclidean spatial features and non-Euclidean structural features, and capture the spatio-temporal dynamics. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world large scale urban traffic datasets and the experimental studies demonstrate MSTIF-Net has achieved superior performance of urban ride-Hailing demand prediction compared with some traditional state-of-art baseline models.}

Furthermore, their visibility range can be expanded by providing highly up-to-date information from areas that are currently invisible. For another example, the road weather—up-to-the-minute visibility, precipitation, and pavement condition information—can be provided at high spatial resolution. Intelligent Transportation efforts are currently being undertaken throughout the world. In addition to the IntelliDrive initiative of the US Department of Transportation, similar efforts exist in Europe, Japan, and China. But these efforts are largely decoupled from, and often incognizant of, the advances in spatio-temporal information management. This paper outlines a spatio-temporal data management language, Transportation Query Language (TranQuyl), which will facilitate the specification of a wide variety of queries of interest to travelers, to transportation agencies, and to industry. Queries in TranQuyl may be processed in either client server mode, or mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) mode, or both. TranQuyl will provide support for the specification of uncertainty either quantitatively or qualitatively as fuzzy queries, for example: “retrieve safety/emergency information around me”. In response, query processing should avoid overloading the traveler with information, and instead present only the most relevant answers to the query.}

This study makes use of a national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center to identify the affective, socio-demographic and technology-use attributes that affect an individual’s perception of the safety of sharing the road with AVs (PSSRAV) and identifies measures and interventions that can be undertaken to improve PSSRAV. Additionally, we evaluate individual preferences for AV regulations. Our results underscore the importance of the need for service providers and public agencies to be cognizant of the demographic and lifestyle/affective emotion considerations shaping AV safety perceptions and opinions about AV regulations. In particular, there is a need not only to focus on technological and other infrastructure components of AV development, but also to recognize the socio-technical considerations and human-related factors of the end-users. Our findings should be of substantial interest in the planning, design, deployment, and introduction of AVs within a safe and minimally regulated public operating arena.}

However, there are computational challenges for solving this Timetable Synchronization Problem (TSP) for large, real-world urban PT networks. Hence, in this study we propose a data-driven, passenger-oriented methodology as a preparatory selection stage to reduce problem dimensionality by (1) determining the significant transfer hubs in the network, and (2) identifying subsets of lines within these hubs that need to be prioritized for transfer synchronization. In the first phase of our methodology we determine the spatial boundaries of transfer locations, using a clustering technique based on the passenger transfer flow matrix inferred from smartcard data. After that, a subset of hubs to be prioritized for synchronization is selected. In the second phase, we characterize the transfer patterns within the hubs based on a topological representation. Based on these topological graphs, the line bundles that need to be prioritized within the hubs are further identified using a modularity-based community detection technique. We apply our methodology to a real-world case study, i.e. the PT network of The Hague, the Netherlands. For this case study, our approach allows for prioritizing 70% of all transfers within identified transfer locations while only requiring 0.9% of these transfer locations, thus reducing the complexity of solving the TSP substantially at a relatively low cost. Our method supports public transport operators during timetable design and real-time control in determining where and which lines to prioritize when devising measures for improving transfer experience and synchronization.}

To mitigate bus bunching, this paper presents a predictive framework to capture the stop-level headway irregularity based on transit smart card data. Historical headway, passenger demands, and travel time are utilized to model the headway fluctuation at the following stops. A Least Squares Support Vector Machine regression is established to detect bus bunching with the predicted headway pattern. An empirical experiment with two bus routes in Beijing is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The predictive method can successfully identify more than 95% of bus bunching occurrences in comparison with other well-established prediction algorithms. Moreover, the detection accuracy does not significantly deteriorate as the prediction lead time increases. Instead of regularizing the headways at all costs by adopting certain correction actions, the proposed framework can provide timely and accurate information for potential bus bunching prevention and inform passengers when the next bus will arrive. This feature will greatly increase transit ridership and reduce operating costs for transit authorities.}

For aggregated data under stationary conditions, flow and density are related by the fundamental diagram. However, high resolution data obtained from modern sensor networks is generally non-stationary and disaggregated. Such data consequently show significant statistical fluctuations. These fluctuations are best described using a bivariate probability distribution in the density–flow plane. By applying kernel density estimation to high-volume data from the UK National Traffic Information Service (NTIS), we empirically construct these distributions for London’s M25 motorway. Curves in the density–flow plane are then constructed, analogous to quantiles of univariate distributions. These curves quantitatively separate atypical fluctuations from typical traffic states. Although the algorithm identifies anomalies in general rather than specific events, we find that fluctuations outside the 95% probability curve correlate strongly with the spikes in travel time associated with significant congestion events. Moreover, the size of an excursion from the typical region provides a simple, real-time measure of the severity of detected anomalies. We validate the algorithm by benchmarking its ability to identify labelled events in historical NTIS data against some commonly used methods from the literature. Detection rate, time-to-detect and false alarm rate are used as metrics and found to be generally comparable except in situations when the speed distribution is bi-modal. In such situations, the new algorithm achieves a much lower false alarm rate without suffering significant degradation on the other metrics. This method has the additional advantages of being self-calibrating and adaptive: the curve marking atypical behaviour is different for each section of road and can evolve in time as the data changes, for example, due to long-term roadworks.}

abstract = {An important aspect of Intelligent Public Transportation Systems (IPTS) is providing accurate travel time information. Knowing arrival times of public vehicles in advance can reduce waiting times of passengers and attract more people to take public transport. Existing approaches have two main limitations in the field of bus travel time prediction. First, influenced by increasingly complex real-time traffic factors and sparsity of real-time data, bus travel times can be difficult to predict accurately in modern cities. Second, bus dwelling and transit times are predominantly affected by different factors and hence have different patterns, but little research focuses on how to divide dwelling and transit areas and to build independent models for them. Consequently, we propose a novel segment-based approach to predict bus travel times using a combination of real-time taxi and bus datasets, that can automatically divide bus routes into dwelling and transit segments. Two models are built to predict them separately by incorporating different impact traffic factors. We evaluate our approach using real-world trajectory datasets, collected in Xi’an, China during June 2017. Compared to existing methods, the experimental results reveal that our approach improves the accuracy of bus travel time prediction, especially under abnormal traffic conditions.}

abstract = {With the availability of large volumes of real-time traffic flow data along with traffic accident information, there is a renewed interest in the development of models for the real-time prediction of traffic accident risk. One challenge, however, is that the available data are usually complex, noisy, and even misleading. This raises the question of how to select the most important explanatory variables to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy for real-time traffic accident risk prediction. To address this, the present paper proposes a novel Frequent Pattern tree (FP tree) based variable selection method. The method works by first identifying all the frequent patterns in the traffic accident dataset. Next, for each frequent pattern, we introduce a new metric, herein referred to as the Relative Object Purity Ratio (ROPR). The ROPR is then used to calculate the importance score of each explanatory variable which in turn can be used for ranking and selecting the variables that contribute most to explaining the accident patterns. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed variable selection method, the study develops two traffic accident risk prediction models, based on accident data collected on interstate highway I-64 in Virginia, namely a k-nearest neighbor model and a Bayesian network. Prior to model development, two variable selection methods are utilized: (1) the FP tree based method proposed in this paper; and (2) the random forest method, a widely used variable selection method, which is used as the base case for comparison. The results show that the FP tree based accident risk prediction models perform better than the random forest based models, regardless of the type of prediction models (i.e. k-nearest neighbor or Bayesian network), the settings of their parameters, and the types of datasets used for model training and testing. The best model found is a FP tree based Bayesian network model that can predict 61.11% of accidents while having a false alarm rate of 38.16%. These results compare very favorably with other accident prediction models reported in the literature.}

Around logistics hubs such as seaports, truck flows can have a major impact on the surrounding motorways. Hence, their prediction is important to help manage traffic operations. However, The link between short-term dynamics of logistics activities and the generation of truck traffic has not yet been properly explored. This paper aims to develop a model that predicts short-term changes in truck volumes, generated from major container terminals in maritime ports. We develop, test, and demonstrate the model for the port of Rotterdam. Our input data are derived from exchanges of operational logistics messages between terminal operators, carriers and shippers, via the local Port Community System. We propose a feed-forward neural network to predict the next one hour of outbound truck traffic. To extract hidden features from the input data and select a model with appropriate features, we employ an evolutionary algorithm in accordance with the neural network model. Our model predicts outbound truck volumes with high accuracy. We formulate 2 scenarios to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the model. The model predicts lag and non-proportional responses of truck flows to changes in container turnover at terminals. The findings are relevant for traffic management agencies to help improve the efficiency and reliability of transport networks, in particular around major freight hubs.}

These companies employ surge pricing in real time to balance the needs of both drivers and riders. The prediction of surge prices in the next few minutes to hours encapsulates the complex evolution of service fleets and service demand in the short term. Surge pricing, if effectively predicted and disseminated to both drivers and riders, can be used to more efficiently allocate vehicles, save users money and time, and provide profitable insight to drivers, which ultimately helps the efficiency and reliability of transportation networks. This paper explores the spatio-temporal correlations between the urban environment, traffic flow characteristics, and surge multipliers. We propose a general framework for predicting the short-term evolution of surge multipliers in real-time using a log-linear model with L1 regularization, coupled with pattern clustering. This model is able to predict Uber surge multipliers in Pittsburgh up to two hours in advance using data from the previous hour out-performing the overall mean and the historical average in all but 3 of the 49 locations in Pittsburgh and outperforming three non-linear methods in 28 of the 49 locations. The model is able to out-perform the overall mean, historical mean, and non-linear methods on Lyft surge multipliers in Pittsburgh up to 20 min in advance. Cross-correlation of Uber and Lyft surge multipliers is also explored.}

Yet, the scope of ITS is not limited to vehicles, as pedestrians are special road users that play an important role in affecting traffic, road infrastructure, and vehicle design. Pedestrians are deemed to be the most vulnerable road users and are the major sufferers of road-incident fatalities and injuries each year. Therefore, quite a few studies have focused on pedestrian’s support and safety. On the other hand, due to imperceptible behavior, a pedestrian may also negatively impact traffic efficiency and can thus be viewed as an obstacle for fully realizing the advantages of ITS. In addition, more issues related to pedestrians have been raised with the emergence of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we discuss different issues related to pedestrians as road users. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive survey and classification of the different solutions of pedestrian protection.

A novel data-based method is presented for designing a Personalized Adaptive Cruise Control (PACC) system in this paper. First, a driving-data-acquisition platform is established, and a large amount of real-world driving data from 84 human drivers is collected. To measure the similarity of human drivers quantitatively, the driving data of every driver are regarded as a specific distribution of some features, fitted with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced as the driving similarity index. After that, an unsupervised clustering algorithm is realized in this paper, and these drivers are grouped into three separate groups. A practical PACC structure is designed in the second stage based on the grouped driving data to include different driving characteristics, mainly in three aspects: speed control, distance control, and the switching rule. Then real-vehicle experiments are carried out. Results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed PACC algorithm to reflect different driving styles.}

Therefore, this study designed and validated a prediction method based on the supervised learning model with added behavioral and physiological features. The data samples were extracted from 130 drivers’ simulator driving, and included various features generated from synchronized recording of vehicle dynamics, distance metrics, driving behaviors, fixations and physiological measures. In order to identify the optimal configuration of proposed method, the Discriminant Analysis (DA) with different features and models (i.e. linear or quadratic) was tested to classify the crash samples and non-crash samples. The results demonstrated the significant improvements of accuracy and specificity with added visual and physiological features. The different models also showed significant effects on the characteristics of sensitivity and specificity. These results supported the effectiveness of crash prediction by quantifying drivers’ risky states as inputs. More importantly, such an approach also provides opportunities to integrate the driver state monitoring into other vehicle-mounted systems at the software level.}

In addition, the LSTM NN can automatically determine the optimal time lags. To validate the effectiveness of LSTM NN, travel speed data from traffic microwave detectors in Beijing are used for model training and testing.

The rise of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) enable provision of travel information through advanced traveler information systems (ATIS). Current ATIS based on shortest path routing might expedite traffic to converge towards the suboptimal User Equilibrium (UE) state. We consider that ATIS can persuade drivers to cooperate, pushing the road network in the long run towards the System Optimum (SO) instead. We develop an agent based model that simulates day-to-day evolution of road traffic on a simple binary road network, where the behavior of agents is reinforced by their previous experiences. Scenarios are generated based on various network designs, information recommendation allocations and incentive mechanisms and tested regarding efficiency, stability and equity criteria. Results show that agents learn to cooperate without incentives, but this is highly sensitive to the type of recommendation allocation and network-specific design. Punishment or rewards are useful incentives, especially when cooperation between agents requires them to change behavior against their natural tendencies. The resulting system optimal states are to most parts efficient, stable and not least equitable. The implications for future ATIS design and operations are further discussed.}

The method is based on a nonlinear state-space system derived from aircraft point-mass performance models. Using only aircraft surveillance data, flight states such as position, velocity, wind speed, and air temperature are collected and used for the estimations. With the regularized Sample Importance Re-sampling particle filter, we are able to estimate the aircraft mass within 30 seconds once an aircraft is airborne. Using this short flight segment allows the assumption of constant mass and thrust setting. The segment at the start of the climb also represents the time when maximum thrust setting is most likely to occur. This study emphasizes an important aspect of the estimation problem, the observation noise modeling. Four observation noise models are proposed, which are all based on the native navigation accuracy parameters that have been obtained automatically from the surveillance data. Simulations and experiments are conducted to test the theoretical model. The results show that the particle filter is able to quantify uncertainties, as well as determine the noise limit for an accurate estimation. The method of this study is tested with a data-set consisting of 50 Cessna Citation II flights where true masses were recorded.}

We investigate the existing neural network based microscopic car following models, and find out that they are generally accurate in predicting traffic flow dynamics under normal traffic operational conditions. However, they do not maintain accuracy under conditions of traffic oscillation. To bridge this research gap, we first propose four neural network based models and evaluate their applicability to predict traffic oscillation. It is found that, with an appropriate structure and objective function, the recurrent neural network based model has the capability of perfectly re-establishing traffic oscillations and distinguish drivers characteristics. We further compare the proposed model with a classical car following model (Intelligent Driver Model). Based on our case study, the proposed model outperforms the classical car following model in predicting traffic oscillations with different driver characteristics.}

We show that using time-of-day electricity data from midnight to early morning from 322 households in the City of Austin, can make reliable prediction of congestion starting time of several highway segments, at the time as early as 2 am. This predictor significantly outperforms a time-series predictor that uses only real-time travel time data up to 6 am. We found that 8 out of the 10 typical electricity use patterns have statistically significant affects on morning congestion on highways in Austin. Some patterns have negative effects, represented by an early spike of electricity use followed by a drastic drop that could imply early departure from home. Others have positive effects, represented by a late night spike of electricity use possible implying late night activities that can lead to late morning departure from home.}

Since their primary purposes are often non-transportation related, passively-generated data need to be processed to extract trips. Most existing trip extraction methods rely on data that are generated via a single positioning technology such as GPS or triangulation through cellular towers (thereby called single-sourced data). Methods to extract trips from data generated via multiple positioning technologies (called “multi-sourced data”) are absent. And yet, multi-sourced data are increasingly common. Generated using multiple technologies (e.g., GPS, cellular network- and WiFi-based), multi-sourced data contain high variances in their temporal and spatial properties. In this study, we propose a “Divide, Conquer and Integrate” (DCI) framework to extract trips from multi-sourced data. We evaluate the proposed framework by applying it to an app-based data, which is multi-sourced and has high variances in both location accuracy and observation interval (i.e. time interval between two consecutive observations). On a manually labeled sample of the app-based data, the framework outperforms the state-of-the-art SVM model that is designed for GPS data. The effectiveness of the framework is also illustrated by consistent mobility patterns obtained from the app-based data and an externally collected household travel survey data for the same region and the same period.}

Different from previous studies, in DNEAT, we develop a new neural layer, named k-hop temporal node-edge attention layer (k-TNEAT), to capture the temporal evolution of node topologies in dynamic OD graphs instead of the pre-defined relationships among regions. We evaluate our model on two real-world ride-hailing demand datasets (from Chengdu, China, and New York City). The experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms six baseline models and is more robust to demand data with high sparsity.}

abstract = {By conducting a cross-sectional survey at Deutsche Post, a major German postal delivery service provider, we examine to what extent commercial drivers accept the substitution of conventional cars with light-duty e-vehicles (LDEVs). Specifically, we explore drivers’ acceptance from two perspectives. First, we investigate drivers’ perceived satisfaction with LDEVs compared to conventional vehicles. Second, we question whether electric cars in general increase drivers’ perceived efficiency of them. Combining these two perspectives, we show that the greater the drivers’ overall perceived satisfaction with LDEVs is, the higher is the drivers’ perceived efficiency of LDEVs. We prove this by means of perceived usefulness (perceived relative advantage) and perceived ease of use (the opposite of perceived complexity) of LDEVs, using adaptations of Davis’ Technology Acceptance Model and Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations Theory to form our Unified Technology Acceptance Model (UTAM). Our findings suggest that, on average, drivers are slightly more satisfied with the LDEVs than with the available conventional cars (n = 66). If drivers were able to choose their preferred vehicles, the majority of them would favor LDEVs. We detect statistically significant patterns of latent measures affecting perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of LDEVs. Although this paper focuses on German delivery service employees, the methodology presented here could easily be applied to any other enterprise in the growing logistics segment which plans to electrify its car fleet. Hence, our contributions are valuable for transportation research and, more specifically, to all potential commercial EV drivers, e.g., our insights might be relevant for the approx. 500,400 drivers employed in the German logistics sector alone.}

abstract = {Trip purpose is crucial to travel behavior modeling and travel demand estimation for transportation planning and investment decisions. However, the spatial-temporal complexity of human activities makes the prediction of trip purpose a challenging problem. This research, an extension of work by Ermagun et al. (2017) and Meng et al. (2017), addresses the problem of predicting both current and next trip purposes with both Google Places and social media data. First, this paper implements a new approach to match points of interest (POIs) from the Google Places API with historical Twitter data. Therefore, the popularity of each POI can be obtained. Additionally, a Bayesian neural network (BNN) is employed to model the trip dependence on each individual’s daily trip chain and infer the trip purpose. Compared with traditional models, it is found that Google Places and Twitter information can greatly improve the overall accuracy of prediction for certain activities, including “EatOut”, “Personal”, “Recreation” and “Shopping”, but not for “Education” and “Transportation”. In addition, trip duration is found to be an important factor in inferring activity/trip purposes. Further, to address the computational challenge in the BNN, an elastic net is implemented for feature selection before the classification task. Our research can lead to three types of possible applications: activity-based travel demand modeling, survey labeling assistance, and online recommendations.}

Detecting cognitive distraction represents an important function for driver distraction mitigation systems. We developed a layered algorithm that integrated two data mining methods—Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) and supervised clustering—to detect cognitive distraction using eye movement and driving performance measures. In this study, the algorithm was trained and tested with the data collected in a simulator-based study, where drivers drove either with or without an auditory secondary task. We calculated 19 distraction indicators and defined cognitive distraction using the experimental condition (i.e., “distraction” as in the drives with the secondary task, and “no distraction” as in the drives without the secondary task). We compared the layered algorithm with previously developed DBN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The results showed that the layered algorithm achieved comparable prediction performance as the two alternatives. Nonetheless, the layered algorithm shortened training and prediction time compared to the original DBN because supervised clustering improved computational efficiency by reducing the number of inputs for DBNs. Moreover, the supervised clustering of the layered algorithm revealed rich information on the relationship between driver cognitive state and performance. This study demonstrates that the layered algorithm can capitalize on the best attributes of component data mining methods and can identify human cognitive state efficiently. The study also shows the value in considering the supervised clustering method as an approach to feature reduction in data mining applications.}

abstract = {Real-time crash risk evaluation is an emerging analysis topic which can identify crash-prone traffic conditions and further benefit the implementation of the active traffic safety management systems on urban expressways. Studies have been conducted to develop crash risk evaluation models with different modeling techniques. However, they were developed and calibrated with fixed model parameters, which cannot account for different traffic patterns with the spatial-temporal variability, and the on-line model updating issue with in-field streaming traffic data has not been well analyzed. In this study, the Bayesian dynamic logistic regression (Bayesian Dynamic LR) was introduced to develop the real-time crash risk evaluation model, where the model parameters could dynamically change by efficiently integrating a new instance with prior knowledge when it arrives. Firstly, a Bayesian Dynamic LR model was developed and compared with a standard logistic regression (Standard LR) model and four support vector machine (SVM) models with different kernel functions for the prediction accuracy evaluated by the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC). Then, the sensitivity analysis of the Bayesian Dynamic LR model was conducted on its two key parameters, which are forgetting parameter λ and the ratio of crash to non-crash observations. The analyses results concluded as (i) Bayesian Dynamic LR model has by far the best predictive performance, where AUC could reach around 0.987 which is also the very highest in existing related literatures to the best of our knowledge; (ii) using a less informative prior in the updating equation stage, makes the model performance better; (iii) when the crash to non-crash ratio increases from 1:1 to 1:10, the model performance is gradually enhanced and it tends to be stable at the AUC level of 0.971. Finally, an on-line updating modeling framework was proposed from the model implementation perspective and its prediction performance was proved by a full set in real-world, and the implementation challenges in real-world was discussed.}

This is especially valuable for power-split hybrid electrical vehicles (HEV) in order to determine the optimal power-split between two different power sources at any particular time. Certainly, researches in this area have been done, but tradeoffs between optimality, driving-cycle sensitivity, speed of calculation and charge-sustaining (CS) conditions have not been cohesively addressed before. In light of this, a combined approach of a time-efficient powertrain optimization strategy, utilizing trajectory prediction based on IVC and VII is proposed. First, Gipps’ car following model for traffic prediction is used to predict the interactions between vehicles, combined with the cell-transmission-model (CTM) for the leading vehicle trajectory prediction. Secondly, a computationally efficient charge-sustaining (CS) HEV powertrain optimization strategy is analytically derived and simulated, based on the Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle and a CS-condition constraint. A 3D lookup-map, generated offline to interpolate the optimizing parameters based on the predicted speed, is also utilized to speed up the calculations. Simulations are conducted for 6-mile and 15-mile cases with different prediction update timings to test the performance of the proposed strategy against a Rule-Based (RB) control strategy. Results for accurate-prediction cases show 9.6% average fuel economy improvements in miles-per-gallon (MPG) over RB for the 6-mile case and 7% improvements for the 15-mile case. Prediction-with-error cases show smaller average MPG’s improvements, with 1.6% to 4.3% improvements for the 6-mile case and 2.6% to 3.4% improvements for the 15-mile case.}

The state-of-the-art Markov decision process (MDP)-based optimization approaches in infrastructure management, while optimal for solving budget allocation problems, become internally inconsistent upon introducing network constraints. In comparison, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) enables solving complex problem formulations by using simulation techniques and lower dimension value function approximations.

This study developed a methodology for categorizing bicycling environments defined by the bicyclist’s perceived level of safety and comfort. Second-by-second bicycle speed data were collected using global positioning systems (GPS) on public bicycles. A set of features representing the level of bicycling environments was extracted from the GPS-based bicycle speed and acceleration data. These data were used as inputs for the proposed categorization algorithm. A support vector machine (SVM), which is a well-known heuristic classifier, was adopted in this study. A promising rate of 81.6% for correct classification demonstrated the technical feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

Part of the problem relates to the difficulty in collecting comprehensive and reliable information early enough to prepare mitigation measures. A tool that automatically scans the internet for events and predicts their impact would strongly support transport management in many cities in the world. This study addresses the challenges related to retrieving and analyzing web documents about real world events, and using them for demand explanation (if related to a past event) and prediction (if a future one). Transport demand is predicted with a supervised topic modeling algorithm by utilizing information about social events retrieved using various strategies, which made use of search aggregation, natural language processing, and query expansion. It was found that a two-step process produced the highest accuracy for transport demand prediction, where different (but related) queries are used to retrieve an initial set of documents, and then, based on these documents, a final query is constructed that obtains the set of predictive documents. These are then used to model the most discriminating topics related to the transport demand. A framework was proposed that sequentially handles all stages of data gathering, enrichment, and prediction with the intention of generating automated search queries.}

Service providers using such a model can offer a better user experience due to shorter response times, while they also benefit from the increased profits made possible by the global optimization of assignments. This study compares two immediate response strategies (IRSs) in terms of their system performance and individual ability to correctly predict customers’ pickup time windows. It also compares the key performance indicators (KPIs) of global reassignment optimization without immediate responses and several constrained cases in which customer acceptances and rejections are handled by IRSs. Ten combinations of IRSs and service model variations are tested in simulations using the ODM demand data from New York City taxis obtained over one week for varying fleet sizes of between 1,000 and 6,000 vehicles. The results show that in general, the list-based assignments (LBA) approach outperforms the nearest neighbor policy (NNP) as an IRS in most of the scenarios evaluated with respect to KPIs, such as requests served and profit generated for the service provider, while it also produces more empty vehicle mileage and longer customer waiting times. The pickup time window predictions of both LBA and NNP were correct in 68% to 72% of cases in scenarios in which no constraints are induced by the IRS. It was also found that global (re)optimization of assignments helps to improve the profit generated for the service provider, especially if the decision as to which requests are accepted is made during global optimization rather by the IRS. However, such a service model would imply an average customer response time of half the optimization period, which was set to 30s in this study compared to the immediate responses given when using an IRS.}

In this paper, a hybrid EMD–BPN forecasting approach which combines empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and back-propagation neural networks (BPN) is developed to predict the short-term passenger flow in metro systems. There are three stages in the EMD–BPN forecasting approach. The first stage (EMD Stage) decomposes the short-term passenger flow series data into a number of intrinsic mode function (IMF) components. The second stage (Component Identification Stage) identifies the meaningful IMFs as inputs for BPN. The third stage (BPN Stage) applies BPN to perform the passenger flow forecasting. The historical passenger flow data, the extracted EMD components and temporal factors (i.e., the day of the week, the time period of the day, and weekday or weekend) are taken as inputs in the third stage. The experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid EMD–BPN approach performs well and stably in forecasting the short-term metro passenger flow.}

The surrogate model is further enhanced by the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and adaptive sampling to reduce approximation error and improve computational efficiency. To solve the proposed surrogate-based DUE problem on reduced networks, we develop a customized algorithm that integrates the kernel trick with the generalized projection framework. A pre-computation scheme is proposed, which calculates and stores the of kernel matrices and vectors, could further reduce the computational burden.

abstract = {Lane-changing is one of the complex driving tasks that depends on the number of vehicles, objectives, and lanes. A driver often needs to respond to a lane-changing request of a lane-changer, which is a function of their personality traits and the current driving conditions. A connected environment is expected to assist during the lane-changing decision-making process by increasing situational awareness of surrounding traffic through vehicle-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Although the majority of lane-changing decision-making components (e.g., gap acceptance behaviour, lane-changing execution behaviour, and drivers’ response to a heavy vehicle) in a traditional environment (an environment without driving aids) has been frequently investigated, our understanding of drivers’ interactions during the lane-changing decision-making process in a connected environment remains elusive due to the novelty of a connected environment and the scarcity of relevant data. As such, this study examines drivers’ responses to lane-changing requests in a connected environment using the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Seventy-eight participants responded to the lane-changing request of a lane-changer under two randomised driving conditions: baseline (traditional environment without driving aids) and connected environment (with driving aids). A segmentation-based approach is employed to extract drivers’ responses to the lane-changing request and subsequently estimate their response time from trajectory data. Additionally, drivers’ response times are modelled using a random parameter accelerated failure time (AFT) hazard-based duration model. Results reveal that drivers tend to be more cooperative in response to a lane-changing request in the connected environment compared with the baseline condition whereby they tend to accelerate to avoid the lane-changing request. The AFT model suggests that on average drivers’ response times are shorter in the connected environment, implying that drivers respond to the lane-changing request faster in the presence of driving aids. However, at the individual level, connected environment’s impact on drivers’ response times is mixed as drivers’ response times may increase or decrease in the connected environment compared to the baseline condition, for instance, we find that female drivers have lower response times in the connected environment than that of male drivers. Overall, this study finds that drivers in connected environment, on average, take less time to respond and appear to be more cooperative, and thus, are less likely to be engaged in safety–critical events.}

To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm combining the hidden Markov model (HMM) and Bayesian filtering (BF) techniques to recognize a driver’s lane changing intention. In the HMM component, the grammar definition is inspired by speech recognition models, and the output is a preliminary behavior classification. As for the BF component, the final behavior classification is produced based on the current and preceding outputs of the HMMs. A naturalistic data set is used to train and validate the proposed algorithm. The results reveal that the proposed HMM–BF framework can achieve a recognition accuracy of 93.5% and 90.3% for right and left lane changing, respectively, which is a significant improvement compared with the HMM-only algorithm. The recognition time results show that the proposed algorithm can recognize a behavior correctly at an early stage.}

It has been suggested that if drivers comply with suggested recommendations, connected vehicle technology can introduce huge benefits. However, whether drivers will accept suggestions and what factors will influence their likelihood of accepting the suggestions in a connected environment have not been studied. In addition, few models have been developed to predict drivers’ reactions under such conditions. This paper aims to fill the research gap by examining and modeling drivers’ acceptance and behavior when receiving energy- and safety-related speed recommendations through vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. A mixed-subject-design experiment was conducted in a closed-loop test track, Mcity, with seven intersection maneuver scenarios. A generally high compliance rate to the recommended speed strategies was observed that during 72% of the events, drivers changed their intersection-approaching behavior to follow the recommendations. Mixed models were conducted to explore the impacting factors while Principal Component Analysis was used to classify subjective (i.e., self-reported) data into four categories. To predict drivers’ reactions when offered a speed suggestion, Random Forests were built with 13 independent variables, derived from four categories: vehicle kinematic features, device information, driver characteristics, and subjective data. Using this model, drivers’ reactions during each intersection maneuver could be predicted with a reasonably high accuracy about 87.4 m away from the intersection, where the vehicle started to receive signal phase and timing information. Findings in this study can contribute to the optimization of energy-saving algorithms and the improvement of driving safety by using connected vehicle technologies.}

The dynamic OD demand estimation problem (DODE) has been studied for decades, most of which solve the DODE problem on a typical day or several typical hours. There is a lack of methods that estimate high-resolution dynamic OD demand for a sequence of many consecutive days over several years (referred to as 24/7 OD in this research). Having multi-year 24/7 OD demand would allow a better understanding of characteristics of dynamic OD demands and their evolution/trends over the past few years, a critical input for modeling transportation system evolution and reliability. This paper presents a data-driven framework that estimates day-to-day dynamic OD using high-granular traffic counts and speed data collected over many years. The proposed framework statistically clusters daily traffic data into typical traffic patterns using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and k-means methods. A GPU-based stochastic projected gradient descent method is proposed to efficiently solve the multi-year 24/7 DODE problem. It is demonstrated that the new method efficiently estimates the 5-min dynamic OD demand for every single day from 2014 to 2016 on I-5 and SR-99 in the Sacramento region. The resultant multi-year 24/7 dynamic OD demand reveals the daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal and yearly change in travel demand in a region, implying intriguing demand characteristics over the years.}

abstract = {Daily high-frequency trajectory data (e.g., 0.1-s connected vehicle data) provide a promising foundation to improve the observability of travel demand dynamics. However, the raw trajectories are not always accurate and complete due to technical and privacy issues. This paper proposes a data-driven optimization modeling framework to reconstruct the location-duration-path choices for the missing observations from the incomplete trajectories. By processing many-day raw trajectories, we observe a set of historical choices of location-duration-path and identify missing observations in space and time dimensions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply data-driven network-time prisms that reduce the search space for the missing choices. Then, we formulate Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) models with likelihood bounds, a special case of data-driven optimization models using phi-divergences (i.e., χ2 distance), to reconstruct the missing choices. To solve the minimax programs of the DRO models while maintaining tractability, we reformulate and solve the equivalent dual problems of the DRO models based on the strong duality theory. To demonstrate and validate the proposed models, we use a real-world connected vehicle dataset containing around 2,800 connected vehicles over two separate months in Southeast Michigan from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) project and a transportation network from OpenStreetMap.}

Due to the highly nonlinear and multi-modal response function in the calibration of the optimization problem, traditional gradient-based nonlinear regression algorithms or other analytical optimization approaches are inapplicable to deal with the calibration work. In this paper, a surrogate-based simulation optimization approach is proposed to deal with the expensive-to-evaluate response function in the day-to-day dynamics calibration work. More specifically, the kriging metamodel is adopted to surrogate the optimization function of the calibration process. With this meta-modeling approach, a sound solution can be achieved with only a few sampling points in a comfortably afforded computation burden, thus giving a valid estimation of the parameters in the day-to-day dynamics model. Finally, a case study based on the real-world LPR data is conducted to validate the proposed model and calibration method.}

To obtain an effective BN structure, we first analyze the dependencies of the involved factors on each station and among adjacent stations, given domain knowledge and expertise about operational characteristics. We then put forward four candidate BN structures, integrating expert knowledge, the interdependencies learned from real-world data, and real-time prediction and operational requirements. Next, we train the candidate structures based on a 5-fold cross-validation method, using the operational data from Wuhan-Guangzhou (W-G) and Xiamen-Shenzhen (X-S) high-speed railway (HSR) lines in China. The best performing structure is nominated to predict the consequences of disruptions and disturbances in the two HSR lines. Comparisons results show that the proposed model outperforms three other commonly used predictive models, reaching an average prediction accuracy of 96.6%, 74.8%, and 91.0% on the W-G HSR line, and 94.8%, 91.1%, and 87.9% on the X-S HSR line for variables L, N, and T, respectively.}

Traditional detection methods have relied on mechanical or electrical devices placed on top of, or embedded in, pavements. These systems are relatively expensive to install, tend to be unreliable over time, and are limited in their capabilities. Considerable research has been conducted in the area of machine vision for Wide Area Vehicle Detections Systems (WADS). These systems have typically employed conventional image processing and pattern matching algorithms, and many installations have been sensitive to varying lighting conditions, camera perspective, and shadows. In addition, these systems have often required large amounts of computing resources. This paper reports on the development of a new image based vehicle detection system that is based on a simple back propagation/feedforward neural network for tracking vehicles. Application of this concept in a field system is discussed and preliminary results are presented. These results suggest that the neural network vehicle tracking model can be used to reliably detect vehicles. In addition, the training capability of the neural network detection model permits the system to adapt to variations in lighting and camera placement. This should lead to simplified installation and maintenance of WADS.}

Existing works mainly focused on prediction and monitoring of regular passenger flow, which are not suitable for burst passenger flow. In this article, we first formulate the problem as early warning of burst passenger flow. Next, we design a novel framework to solve this problem by our observation that a burst passenger in-flow usually comes after an abnormal passenger out-flow for a subway station, especially when there is a large-scale social crowd event. Our framework consists of two models: (1) Abnormal out-flow detection (AOFD) which detects abnormal out-flows and warns the city administration of the burst in-flow fairly ahead of time. (2) Burst in-flow peak estimation (BIFPE) which estimates burst in-flow peak time and volume. We evaluate our framework with real-world smartcard data of the largest city in China and use large-scale social crowd event data to further explain our model. The result shows that: (1) AOFD can detect abnormal out-flows that would later result in bursts in-flows with better performance and can send warning signal ahead of the time of burst passenger in-flow. (2) BIFPE can effectively estimate the peak time of burst in-flow and can reduce peak volume estimation error compared with the traditional passenger flow prediction models.}

While there has been a considerable amount research and excellent reviews on how mobile phone distractions influence various aspects of driving performance, the mechanisms by which the interactions with mobile phone affect driver performance is relatively unexamined. As such, the aim of this study is to examine the mechanisms involved with mobile phone distractions such as conversing, texting, and reading and the driving task, and subsequent outcomes. A novel human-machine framework is proposed to isolate the components and various interactions associated with mobile phone distracted driving. The proposed framework specifies the impacts of mobile phone distraction as an inter-related system of outcomes such as speed selection, lane deviations and crashes; human-car controls such as steering control and brake pedal use and human-environment interactions such as visual scanning and navigation. Eleven literature-review/meta-analyses papers and 62 recent research articles from 2005 to 2015 are critically reviewed and synthesised following a systematic classification scheme derived from the human-machine system framework. The analysis shows that while many studies have attempted to measure system outcomes or driving performance, research on how drivers interactively manage in-vehicle secondary tasks and adapt their driving behaviour while distracted is scant. A systematic approach may bolster efforts to examine comprehensively the performance of distracted drivers and their impact over the transportation system by considering all system components and interactions of drivers with mobile phones and vehicles. The proposed human-machine framework not only contributes to the literature on mobile phone distraction and safety, but also assists in identifying the research needs and promising strategies for mitigating mobile phone-related safety issues. Technology based countermeasures that can provide real-time feedback or alerts to drivers based on eye/head movements in conjunction with vehicle dynamics should be an important research direction.}

Analytical travel behavior model is needed to predict travelers’ departure time choice and mode switch under such strategies. In this paper, we developed an agent-based model for travellers’ choices of mode and departure time. Departing from the traditional utility maximization theory, this model focuses on the decision-making process based on imperfect information, bounded and distinctive rationalities. In the modeling framework, travelers accumulate experiences and update their spatial and temporal knowledge through a Bayesian learning process. Before making a trip, travelers decide whether to search for alternative departure time and/or travel mode according to their expected search gain and cost. When an additional search happens, travelers decide whether or not to switch to the new departure time and travel mode according to a series of decision conditions. Both the search and decision processes are represented by production (if–then) rules derived from a joint revealed/stated-preference survey data collected in Beijing. Then the agent-based model is applied to evaluate congestion charge policies with various demand scenarios in the 2nd ring road of Beijing. Results suggest that the model can display the peak spreading and mode switch process practically.}

This paper presents, in detail, a practical framework for implementation of an automated, high-resolution, video-based traffic-analysis system, particularly geared towards researchers for behavioural studies and road safety analysis, or practitioners for traffic flow model validation. This system collects large amounts of microscopic traffic flow data from ordinary traffic using CCTV and consumer-grade video cameras and provides the tools for conducting basic traffic flow analyses as well as more advanced, pro-active safety and behaviour studies. This paper demonstrates the process step-by-step, illustrated with examples, and applies the methodology to a case study of a large and detailed study of roundabouts (nearly 80,000 motor vehicles tracked up to 30 times per second driving through a roundabout). In addition to providing a rich set of behavioural data about Time-to-Collision and gap times at nearly 40 roundabout weaving zones, some data validation is performed using the standard Measure of Tracking Accuracy with results in the 85–95% range.}

Reducing the burden placed on users enables researchers to collect data over longer periods, thus improving the quality of travel behavior research. To reduce battery use the smartphone-based application collects GPS data less frequently than other methods.

This work proposes a probabilistic topic model, adapted from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to discover representative and interpretable activity categorization from individual-level spatiotemporal data in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the activity-travel episodes of an individual user are treated as words in a document, and each topic is a distribution over space and time that corresponds to certain type of activity. The model accounts for a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes—the location, start time of day, start day of week, and duration of each activity episode. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using pseudonymized transit smart card data from London, U.K. The results show that the model can successfully distinguish the three most basic types of activities—home, work, and other. As the specified number of activity categories increases, more specific subpatterns for home and work emerge, and both the goodness of fit and predictive performance for travel behavior improve. This work makes it possible to enrich human mobility data with representative and interpretable activity patterns without relying on predefined activity categories or heuristic rules.}

To address these challenges, this study demonstrates the use of behavioral knowledge for designing a particular DNN architecture with alternative-specific utility functions (ASU-DNN) and thereby improving both the predictive power and interpretability. Unlike a fully connected DNN (F-DNN), which computes the utility value of an alternative k by using the attributes of all the alternatives, ASU-DNN computes it by using only k’s own attributes. Theoretically, ASU-DNN can substantially reduce the estimation error of F-DNN because of its lighter architecture and sparser connectivity, although the constraint of alternative-specific utility can cause ASU-DNN to exhibit a larger approximation error. Empirically, ASU-DNN has 2–3% higher prediction accuracy than F-DNN over the whole hyperparameter space in a private dataset collected in Singapore and a public dataset available in the R mlogit package. The alternative-specific connectivity is associated with the independence of irrelevant alternative (IIA) constraint, which as a domain-knowledge-based regularization method is more effective than the most popular generic-purpose explicit and implicit regularization methods and architectural hyperparameters. ASU-DNN provides a more regular substitution pattern of travel mode choices than F-DNN does, rendering ASU-DNN more interpretable. The comparison between ASU-DNN and F-DNN also aids in testing behavioral knowledge. Our results reveal that individuals are more likely to compute utility by using an alternative’s own attributes, supporting the long-standing practice in choice modeling. Overall, this study demonstrates that behavioral knowledge can guide the architecture design of DNN, function as an effective domain-knowledge-based regularization method, and improve both the interpretability and predictive power of DNN in choice analysis. Future studies can explore the generalizability of ASU-DNN and other possibilities of using utility theory to design DNN architectures.}

With the growing demands for global shipping service, vessel destination prediction has shown its significant role in improving the efficiency of decision making in industry and ensuring a safe and efficient maritime traffic environment. Currently, most vessel destination prediction methods focus on regional destination prediction, which has restrictions on destinations and regions. Thus, this paper proposes a general AIS (Automatic Identification System) data-driven model for vessel destination prediction. In this random forest-based model, the similarity between the vessel’s traveling and historical trajectories are measured and utilized to predict the destination. The destination of the historical trajectory, which shares the highest similarity with the traveling trajectory, is predicted as the vessel’s destination. The method is different from previous work which used maritime records as input to predict the destination. In our method, a historical trajectory database was generated from more than 141 million AIS records, which covers 534,824 traveling patterns between ports and more than 5.9 million historical trajectories. Comparative studies were carried out to validate the performance of the proposed model, where eleven state-of-the-art trajectories similarity measurement methods combined with two different decision strategies were implemented and compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model combined with the port frequency-based decision strategy achieves the best prediction accuracy on 35,937 testing trajectories.}

PARKIT provided an experimental environment in which drivers’ choice of car parks, and of the routes chosen to reach them, could be observed and the influence of different levels of parking-stock knowledge (derived from experience or from information provided via roadside message signs) monitored. Separate models were estimated for the drivers’ initial choice of car park and for their revision of that choice as their journey progresses and they learn about actual conditions. The importance of price, walking time and driving distance is confirmed but the addition of variables describing the drivers’ choices on previous days, their expectations and their immediately preceding route-choice, greatly improved the models’ explanatory power. It is noted that variables such as these are not generally considered because they are rarely available to the modeller. Different discrete choice model structures were found to be appropriate for different decisions. Route choice was represented as an exit-choice model (whereby each journey is treated as a sequence of decisions—one at each intersection encountered). The paper discusses the incorporation of these choice models into a network assignment model and concludes that much of the power of the choice models is lost if the network model is not able to support use of information about travellers’ socio-economic characteristics and knowledge of the network and about the detailed network topology.}

With the vast selection of available off-the-shelf schemes and seemingly endless options of sensor systems implemented in research and commercial vehicles, it can be difficult to identify the optimal system for one’s AV application. This article presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art AV perception technology available today. It provides up-to-date information about the advantages, disadvantages, limits, and ideal applications of specific AV sensors; the most prevalent sensors in current research and commercial AVs; autonomous features currently on the market; and localization and mapping methods currently implemented in AV research. This information is useful for newcomers to the AV field to gain a greater understanding of the current AV solution landscape and to guide experienced researchers towards research areas requiring further development. Furthermore, this paper highlights future research areas and draws conclusions about the most effective methods for AV perception and its effect on localization and mapping. Topics discussed in the Perception and Automotive Sensors section focus on the sensors themselves, whereas topics discussed in the Localization and Mapping section focus on how the vehicle perceives where it is on the road, providing context for the use of the automotive sensors. By improving on current state-of-the-art perception systems, AVs will become more robust, reliable, safe, and accessible, ultimately providing greater efficiency, mobility, and safety benefits to the public.}

abstract = {Compared with conventional household one/two days travel survey, GPS-based travel surveys hold many attractive features for travel behaviour studies. Different machine learning-based techniques have been developed to infer the transportation mode based upon GPS data from such surveys. However, nearly none of these studies calculate the sample size required for validating these techniques. Since different surveys target different study areas for different temporal periods and different travel modes, identifying sample sizes for all transport modes at different spatio-temporal granularities is of imperative urgency given the high time and financial costs of GPS-based travel surveys. Here we use road network journey time data of London to calculate appropriate sample sizes for travel surveys designed either for a specific period-of-the-day, day-of-the-week or month-of-the-year. We also use different transportation analysis zones (central, inner and outer London) to demonstrate the spatial variability of the data over these different survey durations. Then we finally calculate and analyse the range of required sample sizes for different travel modes within these spatio-temporal granularities. This case study provides a good reference of sample size design for GPS-based travel survey in big cities.}

The increasing available trajectory data bring benefits and new challenges to the studies of on-demand services. To provide an overview of the benefits and challenges brought by the trajectory data, we provide a survey on recent studies of trajectory analysis (refer to analyzing trajectory datasets) for on-demand services in this paper. Our purposes are at least trifold. First, we highlight the value of trajectory data in understanding on-demand services and discuss the procedures of retrieving information for the demand part and the supply part from raw trajectory data. Second, we categorize related studies into three parts (the demand part, the supply part, and the mixed part) and review the significant findings. For the demand part, we focus on the models proposed for describing and explaining the spatial-temporal characteristics of observed trips. Methods or models proposed for describing trip statistics, scaling laws of trips, and dynamics of ridership are reviewed. We summarize four types of factors that influence the spatial-temporal patterns of demands. For the supply part, we focus on the models proposed for describing the spatial-temporal characteristics of available taxis/ride-sharing cars and modeling the behavior of drivers (i.e., passenger-search behavior and route choice behavior) to explain the spatial-temporal patterns of taxi/ride-sharing supplies. For the mixed part, we focus on studies that apply the uncovered demands/supplies patterns to design recommendation systems and pricing strategies. Third, we discuss the future directions on collecting/releasing trajectory data and future research directions to advance the understanding of on-demand services.}

This paper focuses on the network-wide traffic speed estimation, using trajectory data generated by a city-wide fleet of ride-sourcing vehicles equipped with GPS-capable smartphones. A cell-based map-matching technique is proposed to link vehicle trajectories with road geometries, and to produce network-wide spatio-temporal speed matrices. Data limitations are addressed using the Schatten p-norm matrix completion algorithm, which can minimize speed estimation errors even with high rates of data unavailability. A case study using data from Chengdu, China, demonstrates that the algorithm performs well even in situations involving continuous data loss over a few hours, and consequently, addresses large-scale network-wide traffic state estimation problems with missing data, while at the same time outperforming other data recovery techniques that were used as benchmarks. Our approach can be used to generate congestion maps that can help monitor and visualize traffic dynamics across the network, and therefore form the basis for new traffic management, proactive congestion identification, and congestion mitigation strategies.}

abstract = {To meet the requirements of scenario-based testing for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), driving scenario characterization has become a critical issue. Existing studies have concluded that complexity is a necessary criticality measure for supporting critical AV testing scenario identification. However, the existing scenario complexity quantification studies mainly have two limitations, namely, subjective quantification methods highly rely on human participations and are difficult to apply to big data, and existing objective methods lack consideration of human driver characteristics and hence the performance cannot be guaranteed. To bridge these research gaps, a general objective quantification framework is proposed to quantify human drivers’ judgement on driving environment complexity, by describing the vehicle-vehicle spatial-temporal interactions from the perspectives of quantity, variety, and relations. The model mainly contains three parts. First, to describe quantity information, a dynamic influencing area was set to identify the surrounding vehicles that contribute to driving environment complexity based on Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) theory. Second, considering the various surrounding vehicles’ driving statuses, behaviors, and intentions, a basic vehicle-pair complexity quantification model was constructed based on encounter angles. Then, nonlinear relationships based upon information entropy theory were introduced to capture the heterogeneous longitudinal and lateral complexities. Third, a vehicle-pair complexity aggregation and smoothing step was conducted to reflect the characteristics of human driver's cognition. To demonstrate the abovementioned model, empirical Field Operational Test (FOT) data from Shanghai urban roadways were used to conduct case studies, and it can be concluded that this model can accurately describe the timing and extent of the complexity change, and reveal the complexity differences due to scenario type and spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Besides, Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) index was calculated to validate the consistency of scenario complexity judgement between the proposed model and human drivers, and for performance comparison with the existing models. Finally, the applications of the proposed model and its further investigations have been discussed.}

abstract = {Travel surveys based on global positioning system (GPS) data have exponentially increased over the past decades. Trip characteristics, including trip ends, travel modes, and trip purposes need to be detected from GPS data. Compared with other trip characteristics, studies on trip purpose detection are limited. These studies struggle with three types of limitations, namely, data validation, classification approach-related issues, and result comparison under multiple scenarios. Therefore, we attempt to obtain full understanding and improve these three aspects when detecting trip purposes in the current study. First, a smartphone-based travel survey is employed to collect GPS data, and a surveyor-intervened prompted recall survey is used to validate trip characteristics automatically detected from the GPS data. Second, artificial neural networks combined with particle swarm optimization are used to detect trip purposes from the GPS data. Third, four scenarios are constructed by employing two methods for land-use type coding, i.e., polygon-based information and point of interest, and two methods for selecting training dataset, i.e., equal proportion selection and equal number selection. The accuracy of trip purpose detection is then compared under these scenarios. The highest accuracies of 97.22% for the training dataset and 96.53% for the test dataset are achieved under the scenario of polygon-based information and equal proportion selection by comparing the detected and validated trip purposes. Promising results indicate that a smartphone-based travel survey can complement conventional travel surveys.}

To understand the recent development and ultimately inspire new research ideas on this important topic, this survey systematically and comprehensively reviews the existing AV-involved traffic flow models with different levels of details, and examines the relationship among the design of AV-based driving strategies, the management of transportation systems, and the resulting traffic dynamics.

abstract = {A comprehensive assessment of connected and automated driving is imperative before its large-scale deployment in reality, which can be economically and effectively implemented via a credible simulation platform. Nonetheless, the key components of traffic dynamics, vehicle modeling, and traffic environment are oversimplified in existing simulators. Current traffic simulators normally simplify the function of connected and autonomous vehicles by proposing incremental improvements to the conventional traffic flow modeling methods, which cannot reflect the characteristics of the realistic connected and autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, typical autonomous vehicle simulators only focus on individual function verification in some specific traffic scenarios, omitting the network-level evaluation by integrating both large-scale traffic networks and vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication. This paper designs a comprehensive simulation platform for conventional, connected and automated driving from a transportation cyber–physical system perspective, which tightly combines the core components of V2X communication, traffic networks, and autonomous/conventional vehicle model. Specifically, three popular open-source simulators SUMO, Omnet++, and Webots are integrated and connected via the traffic control interface, and the whole simulation platform will be deployed in a Client/Server model. As the demonstration, two typical applications, traffic flow optimization and vehicle eco-driving, are implemented in the simulation platform. The proposed platform provides an ideal and credible testbed to explore the potential social/economic impact of connected and automated driving from the individual level to the large-scale network level.}

abstract = {Traffic forecasting is a classical task for traffic management and it plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. However, since traffic data are mostly collected by traffic sensors or probe vehicles, sensor failures and the lack of probe vehicles will inevitably result in missing values in the collected raw data for some specific links in the traffic network. Although missing values can be imputed, existing data imputation methods normally need long-term historical traffic state data. As for short-term traffic forecasting, especially under edge computing and online prediction scenarios, traffic forecasting models with the capability of handling missing values are needed. In this study, we consider the traffic network as a graph and define the transition between network-wide traffic states at consecutive time steps as a graph Markov process. In this way, missing traffic states can be inferred step by step and the spatial–temporal relationships among the roadway links can be incorporated. Based on the graph Markov process, we propose a new neural network architecture for spatial–temporal data forecasting, i.e. the graph Markov network (GMN). By incorporating the spectral graph convolution operation, we also propose a spectral graph Markov network (SGMN). The proposed models are compared with baseline models and tested on three real-world traffic state datasets with various missing rates. Experimental results show that the proposed GMN and SGMN can achieve superior prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Besides, the proposed models’ parameters, weights, and predicted results are comprehensively analyzed and visualized.}

The PLSR models are built with the components extracted from the training dataset, and it distinguish incidents state from normal traffic state according to the output whether exceeding the threshold predefined. The performance of detection is evaluated using the common criteria of detection rate, false alarm rate, mean time to detection. Moreover, classification rate (CR), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the area under the ROC (AUC) are also used to evaluate the model performance. Several experiments are performed to investigate the potential application of partial least squares regression to automatic incident detection. Simulated traffic data of Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) in Singapore and a real data collected at the I-880 Freeway in California were used in these experiments. The available traffic measurements, including speed, volume and occupancy collected at both upstream and downstream, are used to develop the PLSR model. The experiments conducted on the simulated traffic data studied the influence that the proportion of incident instances in training set and different length of time series of measured data have on the detection performance. In addition, empirical results are presented comparing with neural networks for freeway incident detection. The experiments conducted on the real traffic data discussed the problem resulted from imbalance data (incident instance is rare class in real world), and compares its detection performance with support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results have demonstrated that the PLSR model is comparative to a MLF neural networks and SVM implementation for AID applications, and PLSR has the potential for the application of automatic incident detection in the real world.}

Different data channels from household travel surveys, smartphone type devices, global position systems, and sensors can be mapped to different layers of the proposed network structure. We introduce Big data-driven Transportation Computational Graph (BTCG), alternatively Beijing Transportation Computational Graph, as the underlying mathematical modeling tool to perform automatic differentiation on layers of composition functions. A feedforward passing on the HFN sequentially implements 3 steps of the traditional 4-step process: trip generation, spatial distribution estimation, and path flow-based traffic assignment, respectively. BTCG can aggregate different layers of partial first-order gradients and use the back-propagation of “loss errors” to update estimated demand variables. A comparative analysis indicates that theproposed methods can effectively integrate different data sources and offer a consistent representation of demand. The proposed methodology is also evaluated under a demonstration network in a Beijing subnetwork.}

Not surprisingly, multilayer feedforward networks such as backpropagation have so far been by far the most popular, but there are signs of a growing diversity; practitioners using neural networks are urged to seek out the less well known paradigms and experiment with them themselves. A particular weakness noted in much of the work is the informal approach taken to detailed analysis of the results of the research.

abstract = {Demand for public transportation is highly affected by passengers’ experience and the level of service provided. Thus, it is vital for transit agencies to deploy adaptive strategies to respond to changes in demand or supply in a timely manner, and prevent unwanted deterioration in service quality. In this paper, a real time prediction methodology, based on univariate and multivariate state-space models, is developed to predict the short-term passenger arrivals at transit stations. A univariate state-space model is developed at the station level. Through a hierarchical clustering algorithm with correlation distance, stations with similar demand patterns are identified. A dynamic factor model is proposed for each cluster, capturing station interdependencies through a set of common factors. Both approaches can model the effect of exogenous events (such as football games). Ensemble predictions are then obtained by combining the outputs from the two models, based on their respective accuracy. We evaluate these models using data from the 32 stations on the Central line of the London Underground (LU), operated by Transport for London (TfL). The results indicate that the proposed methodology performs well in predicting short-term station arrivals for the set of test days. For most stations, ensemble prediction has the lowest mean error, as well as the smallest range of error, and exhibits more robust performance across the test days.}

Traffic flow theory has provided significant resources, including models based on traffic flow fundamentals that reflect the underlying phenomena, as well as promote their understanding. They also provide the basis for many traffic simulation models. Speed–density relationships, for example, are routinely used in mesoscopic models. In this paper, an approach for local traffic state estimation and prediction is presented, which exploits available (traffic and other) information and uses data-driven computational approaches. An advantage of the method is its flexibility in incorporating additional explanatory variables. It is also believed that the method is more appropriate for use in the context of mesoscopic traffic simulation models, in place of the traditional speed–density relationships. While these general methods and tools are pre-existing, their application into the specific problem and their integration into the proposed framework for the prediction of traffic state is new. The methodology is illustrated using two freeway data sets from Irvine, CA, and Tel Aviv, Israel. As the proposed models are shown to outperform current state-of-the-art models, they could be valuable when integrated into existing traffic estimation and prediction models.}

Next, we apply our trained ANN to classify the respondents from a recent Value-of-Time Stated Choice experiment in terms of their most likely employed decision rule. We cross-validate our findings by comparing our results with those from: (1) single class discrete choice models estimated on subsets of the data, and (2) latent class discrete choice models. The cross-validations provide strong support for the notion that ANNs can be used to identify underlying decision rules in choice data.

This research was conducted based on a new visibility detection system by mounting visibility sensor arrays combined with adaptive learning modules to provide more accurate visibility detections. The vehicle-based detector, Wavetronix SmartSensor HD, was installed at the same place to collect traffic data. Reduced visibility due to fog were selected and analyzed by comparing them with clear cases to identify the differences based on several surrogate measures of safety under different visibility classes. Moreover, vehicles were divided into different types and the vehicles in different lanes were compared in order to identify whether the impact of reduced visibility due to fog on traffic crash risk varies depending on vehicle types and lanes. Log-Inverse Gaussian regression modeling was then applied to explore the relationship between time to collision and visibility together with other traffic parameters. Based on the accurate visibility and traffic data collected by the new visibility and traffic detection system, it was concluded that reduced visibility would significantly increase the traffic crash risk especially rear-end crashes and the impact on crash risk was different for different vehicle types and for different lanes. The results would be helpful to understand the change in traffic crash risk and crash contributing factors under fog conditions. We suggest implementing the algorithms in real-time and augmenting it with ITS measures such as VSL and DMS to reduce crash risk.}

abstract = {The accuracy of travel time information given to passengers plays a key role in the success of any Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) application. In order to improve the accuracy of such applications, one should carefully develop a prediction method. A majority of the available prediction methods considered the variation in travel time either spatially or temporally. The present study developed a prediction method that considers both temporal and spatial variations in travel time. The conservation of vehicles equation in terms of flow and density was first re-written in terms of speed in the form of a partial differential equation using traffic stream models. Then, the developed speed based equation was discretized using the Godunov scheme and used in the prediction scheme that was based on the Kalman filter. From the results, it was found that the proposed method was able to perform better than historical average, regression, and ANN methods and the methods that considered either temporal or spatial variations alone. Finally, a formulation was developed to check the effect of side roads on prediction accuracy and it was found that the additional requirement in terms of location based data did not result in an appreciable change in the prediction accuracy. This clearly demonstrated that the proposed approach based on using vehicle tracking data is good enough for the considered application of bus travel time prediction.}

abstract = {Congestion pricing has been proposed and investigated as an effective means of optimizing traffic assignment, alleviating congestion, and enhancing traffic operation efficiencies. Meanwhile, advanced traffic information dissemination systems, such as Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS), have been developed and deployed to provide real-time, accurate, and complete network-wide traffic information to facilitate travelers’ trip plans and routing selections. Recent advances in ATIS technologies, especially telecommunication technology, allow dynamic, personalized, and multimodal traffic information to be disseminated and impact travelers’ choices of departure times, alternative routes, and travel modes in the context of congestion pricing. However, few studies were conducted to determine the impact of traffic information dissemination on toll road utilizations. In this study, the effects of the provisions of traffic information on toll road usage are investigated and analyzed based on a stated preference survey conducted in Texas. A Bayesian Network (BN)-based approach is developed to discover travelers’ opinions and preferences for toll road utilization supported by network-wide traffic information provisions. The probabilistic interdependencies among various attributes, including routing choice, departure time, traffic information dissemination mode, content, coverage, commuter demographic information, and travel patterns, are identified and their impacts on toll road usage are quantified. The results indicate that the BN model performs reasonably well in travelers’ preference classifications for toll road utilization and knowledge extraction. The BN Most Probable Explanation (MPE) measurement, probability inference and variable influence analysis results illustrate travelers using highway advisory radio and internet as their primary mode of receiving traffic information are more likely to comply with routing recommendations and use toll roads. Traffic information regarding congested roads, road hazard warnings, and accident locations is of great interest to travelers, who tend to acquire such information and use toll roads more frequently. Travel time formation for home-based trips can considerably enhance travelers’ preferences for toll road usage. Female travelers tend to seek traffic information and utilize toll roads more frequently. As expected, the information provided at both pre-trip and en-route stages can positively influence travelers’ preferences for toll road usage. The proposed methodology and research findings advance our previous study and provide insight into travelers’ behavioral tendencies concerning toll road utilization in support of traffic information dissemination.}

abstract = {Foresee traffic conditions and demand is a major issue nowadays that is very often approached using simulation tools. The aim of this work is to propose an innovative strategy to tackle such problem, relying on the presentation and analysis of a behavioural dynamic traffic assignment. The proposal relies on the assumption that travellers take routing policies rather than paths, leading us to introduce the possibility for each simulated agent to apply, in real time, a strategy allowing him to possibly re-route his path depending on the perceived local traffic conditions, jam and/or time already spent in his journey. The re-routing process allows the agents to directly react to any change in the road network. For the sake of simplicity, the agents’ strategy is modelled with a simple neural network whose parameters are determined during a preliminary training stage. The inputs of such neural network read the local information about the route network and the output gives the action to undertake: stay on the same path or modify it. As the agents use only local information, the overall network topology does not really matter, thus the strategy is able to cope with large and not previously explored networks. Numerical experiments are performed on various scenarios containing different proportions of trained strategic agents, agents with random strategies and non strategic agents, to test the robustness and adaptability to new environments and varying network conditions. The methodology is also compared against existing approaches and real world data. The outcome of the experiments suggest that this work-in-progress already produces encouraging results in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. This indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to provide better tools to investigate and forecast drivers’ choice behaviours. Eventually these tools can improve the delivery and efficiency of traffic information to the drivers.}

In this paper, we formulate the missing data imputation problem in spatiotemporal traffic data in a low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) framework and define a novel truncated nuclear norm (TNN) on traffic tensors of location × day × time of day. In particular, we introduce an universal rate parameter to control the degree of truncation on all tensor modes in the proposed LRTC-TNN model, and this allows us to better characterize the hidden patterns in spatiotemporal traffic data. Based on the framework of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we present an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal solution for each variable. We conduct numerical experiments on four spatiotemporal traffic data sets, and our results show that the proposed LRTC-TNN model outperforms many state-of-the-art imputation models with missing rates/patterns. Moreover, the proposed model also outperforms other baseline models in extreme missing scenarios.}

All the surrounding obstacles (vehicles and road boundaries) are considered as stimuli that elicit driver’s reactions (lateral and longitudinal accelerations). A Virtual LiDAR sensor on the EV perceives the surrounding. Proximity and speed are used to compute longitudinal and lateral components of average relative velocity. A new formulation is presented to compute the effective gap considering all the surrounding obstacles. It is composed of four components: front, rear, left, and right. The former two affect longitudinal acceleration, while the latter two influence lateral acceleration of the EV. A discretionary lane-change model is also developed to account for the driver’s deliberate (not just mandatory) lateral movements. A total of 13 model parameters are used, of which eight are newly introduced. These model parameters are calibrated using 1050 human-driven car trajectories from Next Generation SIMulation dataset. Taguchi’s fractional factorial design principle is used to optimize the parameters. Gray relational analysis indicated that the three newly introduced parameters to be the three most influential parameters. Validation using another 450 car trajectories resulted in a mean radial error of 3.97 m over a horizon of 10 s. The performance measures of two-dimensional motion planning (model error, longitudinal error, and mixed gap error) are found to be better than those reported in the literature.

abstract = {This study proposes an addition to the architecture of the context-aware Driver Assistance Systems (DASs) by introducing a context identification layer to the reasoning subsystem. The proposed layer contains two algorithms that work in sequence: the infrastructure detection algorithm and the driver classification algorithm, respectively. The infrastructure detection algorithm aims to identify intersection-related driving when the driver adjusts his or her behavior due to the presence of an intersection ahead. Then, the driver classification algorithm categorizes drivers into cautious, normal, and aggressive at both locations. Data from 64 drivers in a Naturalistic Driving Study was used to prove the concept of the proposed layer. Several behavioral measures were extracted, including following distance, relative speed, headway, acceleration, time-to-collision, and jerk. These behavioral measures were then used to train the algorithms in the context identification layer. The results of both algorithms supported the concept of the proposed layer. These results have implications related to driver behaviors including i) the intersection-related driving behavior can be detected, ii) the drivers tend to be relatively aggressive at intersections when compared to segments, and iii) the driver classification, which ignores the driver’s relative location to intersections, were more likely to misclassify drivers as aggressive when they were in high intersection density areas such as downtown cores. The findings of this study emphasized the importance of context-aware DAS architecture that acknowledges and integrates the variation in driver behavior due to both a change in the surrounding environment and drivers’ individual needs.}

First, it is shown how difficult the underlying classification task is, this mainly due to strongly overlapped classes, which cannot be easily separated by simple hyper-planes. Then, a novel soft radial basis cellular neural/nonlinear network (SRB-CNN) based concept is developed, validated and extensively benchmarked with a selection of the best representatives of the current related state-of-the-art classification concepts (namely the following: support vector machines with radial basis function, artificial neural network, naive Bayes, and decision trees). For benchmarking purposes, all selected competing classifiers do use the same features and the superiority of the novel CNN based classifier is thereby underscored, as it strongly outperforms the other ones.

The results show the proposed model can produce accurate imputations even under temporally correlated data corruption.

There has been little prior work on the selection of a set of features from a large number of proposed features, especially for sparse GPS data. This article considers characteristics of distribution, auto- and cross-correlations, and spectral features of speed and acceleration as possible features, and presents an approach to selecting the most significant, non-correlating features from among those. Both speed and acceleration are inferred from changes in location and time between data points. Using GPS traces of buses in the city of Tampere, and of walking, biking and driving from the OpenStreetMap and Microsoft GeoLife projects, spectral bins were found to be among the most significant non-correlating features for differentiating between walking, bicycle, bus and driving, and were used to train classifiers with a fair accuracy. Auto- and cross-correlations, kurtoses and skewnesses were found to be of no use in the classification task. Useful features were found to have a fairly large (>0.4) correlation with each other.}

To address them adequately, the acquisition of reliable data about traffic flow is an essential prerequisite. However, the large quantity and the heterogeneity of available information often cause problems; missing or incomplete data are one of the most critical aspects. This paper discusses how technology handles imperfect information in order to obtain more accurate quantification of CO2 emissions. First, an analysis of single estimators and combination models is provided, highlighting their main characteristics. Then, the TANINO model (Tool for the Analysis of Non-conservative Carbon Emissions In TraNspOrt) is presented, jointly developed at the University of Seville and at the IUAV University of Venice. It consists of two different modules: the first is a combination model that optimizes the results of three traffic flow single estimators, while the second is a macro-model of carbon evaluation, which takes into account road infrastructure, vehicle type and traffic conditions. TANINO is then tested to calculate CO2 emissions along the ring road of the Spanish city of Seville, showing its more efficient performance, compared to the single estimators normally adopted for such aims. Transport planning can benefit from the adequate knowledge of traffic flows and related CO2 emissions, since it allows a more reliable monitoring of the progresses granted by specific carbon policies.}

A case study is discussed based on the usage data from Mobike, one of the largest operating bike-sharing systems in Shanghai (China). The daily usage dynamics is modeled using log-normal distributions. Random Forest is adopted to explore the impact of factors on the usage frequency in different districts. It is found that residential area, park & green area, and population size are the top three factors influencing the frequency. Particularly, usage near metro stations is delved using the hierarchical clustering method, resulting in three typical usage modes. Visualization analysis is demonstrated to understand the time-varying flow patterns and the spatial distribution of shared bikes.

Real-time traffic control by use of green–red traffic signals at the motorway mainstream is proposed in order to achieve safer merging of vehicles entering the work zone and, at the same time, maximize throughput and reduce travel delays. A significant issue that had been neglected in previous research is the investigation of the impact of distance between the merge area and the traffic lights so as to achieve, in combination with the employed real-time traffic control strategy, the most efficient merging of vehicles. The control strategy applied for real-time signal operation is based on an ALINEA-like proportional–integral (PI-type) feedback regulator. In order to achieve maximum performance of the control strategy, some calibration of the regulator’s parameters may be necessary. The calibration is first conducted manually, via a typical trial-and-error procedure. In an additional investigation, the recently proposed learning/adaptive fine-tuning (AFT) algorithm is employed in order to automatically fine-tune the regulator parameters. Experiments conducted with a microscopic simulator for a hypothetical work zone infrastructure, demonstrate the potential high benefits of the control scheme.}

Then, the extended Vasicek model (EV) is employed for modeling the difference between observations and baseline predictions (residuals) during an individual day. The parameters of this time-varying model are estimated at each sample using the residuals in a short duration of time before the time point of prediction; so it provides a real time prediction. The extracted model recovers the valuable local variation information during each day. The performance of our method in comparison with other methods improves significantly in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE) for real data from Tehran’s highways and the open-access PeMS database.

Network-wide traffic volume information is of great benefit for traffic planning, government management and vehicle emissions control. However, it is difficult to install detectors on every intersection due to the expensive deployment and maintenance costs, and the insufficient sensor coverage across the network limits the direct availability of network-wide traffic flow information. Whereas, crowdsourcing floating car data with a high coverage rate are currently available, which creates an opportunity to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to estimate network-wide traffic flow, which incorporates flow records and crowdsourcing floating car data into a geometric matrix completion model. Furthermore, a spatial smoothing index based on the divergence is developed to measure the difficulty of volume estimation for each road segment. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other benchmark models and that the proposed index is highly correlated to estimation accuracy.}

abstract = {With the advent of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), spatiotemporal traffic data has gained growing importance in real-time monitoring, prediction, and control of traffic. However, in practical implementations, data collection devices are often faced with malfunctions caused by various unpredictable disruptions, thereby resulting in the so-called “missing value problems.” In realistic cases, the disruptions to the data collection devices are often associated with some key events (e.g., power cut and natural disasters), in addition, along with other disruptions the missing value problem could be in a complicated manner with both randomly and completely missing patterns. To perform the imputation task with such complicated missing patterns, we propose a hybrid spatiotemporal method which utilizes the time series properties by “prophet” model and captures the spatial residuals information by iterative random forest model. The spatiotemporal method first applies the temporal part to fill the missing value and then adopts the spatial part to acquire the residual component of the missing values. The results of the two components are integrated into the final imputations. Based on the PeMS freeway dataset (PeMS, 2019) and an urban road dataset under extensive artificially designed scenarios like randomly, clustered non-completely and completely missing patterns, we test our proposed approach with some existing techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL), Bayesian tensor decomposition, Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE). The test results indicate that the hybrid method achieves the best imputation quality for most missing patterns, particularly for those with completely or hybrid missing patterns. Furthermore, the hybrid model still performs well under extreme missing rates as high as 0.9, which validates the robustness of the model in extreme situations.}

abstract = {Traffic congestion is rapidly increasing in urban areas, particularly in mega cities. To date, there exist a few sensor network based systems to address this problem. However, these techniques are not suitable enough in terms of monitoring an entire transportation system and delivering emergency services when needed. These techniques require real-time data and intelligent ways to quickly determine traffic activity from useful information. In addition, these existing systems and websites on city transportation and travel rely on rating scores for different factors (e.g., safety, low crime rate, cleanliness, etc.). These rating scores are not efficient enough to deliver precise information, whereas reviews or tweets are significant, because they help travelers and transportation administrators to know about each aspect of the city. However, it is difficult for travelers to read, and for transportation systems to process, all reviews and tweets to obtain expressive sentiments regarding the needs of the city. The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing the information available on social network platforms and performing sentiment analysis. On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce inadequate results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based sentiment analysis and semantic web rule language (SWRL) rule-based decision-making to monitor transportation activities (accidents, vehicles, street conditions, traffic volume, etc.) and to make a city-feature polarity map for travelers. This system retrieves reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation activities. The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are developed by using Protégé web ontology language (OWL) and Java, respectively. The experimental results show satisfactory improvement in tweet and review analysis and opinion mining.}

abstract = {The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods, such as autoregressive or spatio-temporal models, is often extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance, particularly by midnight (called ‘next-day morning traffic prediction’ thereafter). In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as a probing method to understand the impacts of people’s work and rest patterns in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic. The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides, people’s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning (by 5am) are statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning commute congestion using people’s tweeting profiles extracted by 5am. In most cases, the tweet information collected by the midnight before is sufficient to make good prediction for next-day morning traffic. The Pittsburgh study supports that this framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion variation, while its prediction performance being no worse than baseline methods on other roads. Through experiments, we demonstrate our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights. The proposed social media empowered framework can be a promising tool for real-time traffic management and potentially extended for traffic prediction at other times of day.}

abstract = {The importance of calibration of microscopic traffic models as the main core of traffic simulation software results from the need for more realistic traffic behaviors. The latent essence of several parameters in such models as well as the uncertainties resulting from the noise in the data, make the process of calibration much more complex. Usually, the calibration process is formulated as an optimization problem. Selecting the appropriate solution algorithm due to nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem is crucial. The importance of the issue is more significant when the matter of calibrating the medium or large-scale simulation model is considered. This is mainly due to the expensive cost that running the simulation models impose. Therefore, applying the current algorithms in which finding the appropriate solutions requires a large number of simulation runs is not deemed suitable. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm based on copula theory has been suggested. In contrast with traditional solution algorithms, in the proposed algorithm complex interaction between parameters of a model has been considered by constructing and sampling from a copula-based probabilistic model. Copulas are functions that describe the dependence structure of a set of random variables and connect multivariate distribution functions to one-dimensional marginal distribution functions. The results indicate that applying an explicit probabilistic model based on copula helps the estimation of distribution algorithm to explore the search space more effectively and efficiently as well as provides the possibility of extracting the knowledge with regard to the structure of the calibration problem through analyzing the probabilistic models that are constructed during the evolution process. Furthermore, this new algorithm has been compared with the genetic algorithm and kernel-based cross-entropy method on synthetic and real trajectory data. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in terms of convergence rate, resource usage and more robust in terms of the probability of finding the global optimal solution.}

While GPS data, typically collected by smartphone apps, are restricted to rather small samples of the population, mobile phone network data, routinely collected by mobile network operators, potentially allow to analyze travel behaviors and social interaction of the whole population, with full temporal (e.g., longitudinal) coverage at a comparatively low cost. Therefore, recent years have seen an increasing interest in using such data for human mobility studies. However, due to their noisy and temporally infrequent/irregular nature, extracting mobility information such as transport modes from these data is particularly challenging. This paper provides an in-depth, systematic review of transport mode detection based on mobile phone network data. The results of the review show that existing studies tend to identify easy-to-detect modes (e.g., train or metro), or aggregate fine-grained modes into more general groups (e.g., public versus private transport). Rule-based methods making use of geographic data were often developed. More importantly, due to the lack of ground truth data, evaluation of the proposed methods was seldom done and reported. Finally, we identify a list of research gaps currently being faced in this field, particularly regarding robust and real-time data cleaning and mode detection methods, “benchmark” datasets and metrics allowing the comparison of different mode detection methods, as well as privacy and bias issues.}

abstract = {Transport demand is highly dependent on supply, especially for shared transport services where availability is often limited. As observed demand cannot be higher than available supply, historical transport data typically represents a biased, or censored, version of the true underlying demand pattern. Without explicitly accounting for this inherent distinction, predictive models of demand would necessarily represent a biased version of true demand, thus less effectively predicting the needs of service users. To counter this problem, we propose a general method for censorship-aware demand modeling, for which we derive a censored likelihood function capable of handling time-varying supply. We apply this method to the task of shared mobility demand prediction by incorporating the censored likelihood within a Gaussian Process model, which can flexibly approximate arbitrary functional forms. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show how taking into account the limiting effect of supply on demand is essential in the process of obtaining an unbiased predictive model of user demand behavior.}

In this paper, the authors developed a proof of concept predictor of operational acceptability for route changes during a flight. Such a capability could have applications in automation tools that identify more efficient routes around airspace impacted by weather or congestion and that better meet airline preferences. The predictor is based on applying data mining techniques, including logistic regression, a decision tree, a support vector machine, a random forest and Adaptive Boost, to historical flight plan amendment data reported during operations and field experiments. Cross validation was used for model development, while nested cross validation was used to validate the models. The model found to have the best performance in predicting air traffic controller acceptance or rejection of a route change, using the available data from Fort Worth Air Traffic Control Center and its adjacent Centers, was the random forest, with an F-score of 0.77. This result indicates that the operational acceptance of reroute requests does indeed have some level of predictability, and that, with suitable data, models can be trained to predict the operational acceptability of reroute requests. Such models may ultimately be used to inform route selection by decision support tools, contributing to the development of increasingly autonomous systems that are capable of routing aircraft with less human input than is currently the case.}

abstract = {Pedestrians and cyclists are amongst the most vulnerable road users. Pedestrian and cyclist collisions involving motor-vehicles result in high injury and fatality rates for these two modes. Data for pedestrian and cyclist activity at intersections such as volumes, speeds, and space–time trajectories are essential in the field of transportation in general, and road safety in particular. However, automated data collection for these two road user types remains a challenge. Due to the constant change of orientation and appearance of pedestrians and cyclists, detecting and tracking them using video sensors is a difficult task. This is perhaps one of the main reasons why automated data collection methods are more advanced for motorized traffic. This paper presents a method based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients to extract features of an image box containing the tracked object and Support Vector Machine to classify moving objects in crowded traffic scenes. Moving objects are classified into three categories: pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicles. The proposed methodology is composed of three steps: (i) detecting and tracking each moving object in video data, (ii) classifying each object according to its appearance in each frame, and (iii) computing the probability of belonging to each class based on both object appearance and speed. For the last step, Bayes’ rule is used to fuse appearance and speed in order to predict the object class. Using video datasets collected in different intersections, the methodology was built and tested. The developed methodology achieved an overall classification accuracy of greater than 88%. However, the classification accuracy varies across modes and is highest for vehicles and lower for pedestrians and cyclists. The applicability of the proposed methodology is illustrated using a simple case study to analyze cyclist–vehicle conflicts at intersections with and without bicycle facilities.}

In particular, centimeter/decimetre positioning accuracy is required for some safety related applications, such as lane control, collision avoidance, and intelligent speed assistance. Lane-level Anomalous driving detection underpins these safety-related ITS applications. The two major issues associated with such detection are (1) accessing high accuracy vehicle positioning and dynamic parameters; and (2) extraction of irregular driving patterns from such information. This paper introduces a new integrated framework for detecting lane-level anomalous driving, by combining Global Positioning Systems (GPS), BeiDou, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with advanced algorithms. Specifically, we use Unscented Particle Filter (UPF) to perform data fusion with different positioning sources. The detection of different types of Anomalous driving is achieved based on the application of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) with a newly introduced velocity-based indicator. The framework proposed in this paper yield significantly improved accuracy in terms of positioning and Anomalous driving detection compared to state-of-the-art, while offering an economically viable solution for performing these tasks.}

A lack of rigorous evaluation and the existence of an infinite number of possible conflict geometries in Free Flight makes the choice of which algorithm to be placed in the cockpit a challenging task for the designers of future air traffic management (ATM) systems. In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach for CD in Free Flight. The ensemble consists of several CD algorithms, a rule set for each algorithm describing its learned behavior from its past performance and a switch mechanism to choose an appropriate CD algorithm given probe characteristics. A novel mechanism to evolve complex conflict scenarios, using genetic algorithms (GA), is developed and integrated in a fast time air traffic simulator to generate the performance data of CD algorithms. Data mining techniques are then employed to identify implicit patterns in the probe characteristics where the CD algorithms missed or falsely identified a conflict. These patterns are formulated as rule sets for each CD algorithm and are then used by a switch in the ensemble to route a probe for conflict prediction. Given probe characteristics, the CD algorithm, which is less likely to miss or falsely identify a conflict, is selected to evaluate the probe for potential conflict. The performance of the ensemble and of individual algorithms is evaluated by comparing the Pareto efficient set of solutions generated by them. The ensemble approach demonstrates a significant reduction in the number of missed detects and false alarms as compared to individual algorithms. The proposed methodology is capable of accommodating existing as well as new CD models and can be extended to other ATM concepts as well.}

Then, we present a comprehensive literature review in this area, in which the current studies are generally classified into three main aspects, i.e., train operation modeling techniques, train trajectory optimization and train speed control methods. Finally, the emerging requirements for current ATO systems and the most promising research directions in this area in the future are discussed explicitly, including (i) the practical implementation of ATO in main line and high-speed railways, (ii) the cooperative train operation methods for energy-saving issues and (iii) the integration of railway traffic control with advanced ATO technology.}

The evolution towards semi-autonomous and eventually driverless vehicles will progressively remove the leading cause of vehicle accidents, human error, and significantly lower vehicle accident rates. However, this transition will force a departure from existing actuarial methods requires careful management to ensure risks are correctly assigned. Personal motor insurance lines are anticipated to diminish as liability shifts towards OEMs, tier 1 and 2 suppliers and software developers. Vehicle accident risks will hinge on vehicular characteristics in addition to driver related risks as drivers alternate between autonomous and manual driving modes. This paper proposes a Bayesian Network statistical risk estimation approach that can accommodate changing risk levels and the emergence of new risk structures. We demonstrate the use of this method for a Level 3 semi-autonomous vehicle for two scenarios, one where the driver is in control and one where the vehicle is in control. This approach is especially suited to use telematics data generated from the vehicle inherent technologies. We validate the efficacy of this approach from the perspective of the insurer and discuss how vehicle technology development will require a greater degree of collaboration between the insurance company and the manufacturers in order to develop a greater understanding of the risks semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles.}

FFBS saves on start-up cost, in comparison to station-based bike sharing (SBBS), by avoiding construction of expensive docking stations and kiosk machines. FFBS prevents bike theft and offers significant opportunities for smart management by tracking bikes in real-time with built-in GPS. However, like SBBS, the success of FFBS depends on the efficiency of its rebalancing operations to serve the maximal demand as possible. Bicycle rebalancing refers to the reestablishment of the number of bikes at sites to desired quantities by using a fleet of vehicles transporting the bicycles. Static rebalancing for SBBS is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. FFBS takes it a step further, with an increase in the scale of the problem. This article is the first effort in a series of studies of FFBS planning and management, tackling static rebalancing with single and multiple vehicles. We present a Novel Mixed Integer Linear Program for solving the Static Complete Rebalancing Problem. The proposed formulation, can not only handle single as well as multiple vehicles, but also allows for multiple visits to a node by the same vehicle. We present a hybrid nested large neighborhood search with variable neighborhood descent algorithm, which is both effective and efficient in solving static complete rebalancing problems for large-scale bike sharing programs. Computational experiments were carried out on the 1 Commodity Pickup and Delivery Traveling Salesman Problem (1-PDTSP) instances used previously in the literature and on three new sets of instances, two (one real-life and one general) based on Share-A-Bull Bikes (SABB) FFBS program recently launched at the Tampa campus of University of South Florida and the other based on Divvy SBBS in Chicago. Computational experiments on the 1-PDTSP instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms a tabu search algorithm and is highly competitive with exact algorithms previously reported in the literature for solving static rebalancing problems in SBSS. Computational experiments on the SABB and Divvy instances, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to deal with the increase in scale of the static rebalancing problem pertaining to both FFBS and SBBS, while deriving high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of CPU time.}

Previous studies have proposed different approaches for examining the impact of influential factors on incident clearance and response time. However, very few studies have considered incident clearance and response time as two dependent variables and used a joint modeling framework. The objectives of this paper are to investigate the dependence between incident clearance and response time and to examine the applicability of the copula approach to the joint analysis of these two variables. To demonstrate advantages of the proposed copula modelling framework, incident clearance and response time data collected on freeway road sections in Seattle, Washington State are examined. Parameter estimation and prediction results from the proposed copula models are presented and compared with the conventional accelerated failure time model. The modeling results suggest that the proposed copula model can better describe the estimated conditional survival probability of incident clearance time, and can provide marginally more accurate prediction results. The proposed model can also provide different inferences about effects of factors on incident clearance and response time data.

abstract = {Railway big data technologies are transforming the existing track inspection and maintenance policy deployed for railroads in North America. This paper develops a data-driven condition-based policy for the inspection and maintenance of track geometry. Both preventive maintenance and spot corrective maintenance are taken into account in the investigation of a 33-month inspection dataset that contains a variety of geometry measurements for every foot of track. First, this study separates the data based on the time interval of the inspection run, calculates the aggregate track quality index (TQI) for each track section, and predicts the track spot geo-defect occurrence probability using random forests. Then, a Markov chain is built to model aggregated track deterioration, and the spot geo-defects are modeled by a Bernoulli process. Finally, a Markov decision process (MDP) is developed for track maintenance decision making, and it is optimized by using a value iteration algorithm. Compared with the existing maintenance policy using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, the maintenance policy developed in this paper results in an approximately 10% savings in the total maintenance costs for every 1 mile of track.}

The modeling of such behavior is relatively complex as it goes beyond simple route/link choice. Moreover, it involves multiple uncertain events that may appear at different points in the future. In addition, travelers may differ in their attitudes toward risk and the decision heuristics they apply.

abstract = {Suggesting personalized itinerary search for travelers in a multimodal transportation system is a challenging problem. This is due to the increased complexity and diversity of transportation means, the intricacy and multitude of destinations along with the amount of rapidly changing information available to the traveler. Providing the transportation user with the relevant information that only meets his needs, preferences and personal profile is of foremost importance in efficiently supporting passenger mobility requirements in a large urban agglomeration. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria approach for suggesting personalized itinerary to transportation users based on their preferences and needs. The proposed approach integrates case-based reasoning with Choquet integral to suggest the itinerary that best matches the user’s preferences. Further, the proposed method predicts the user’s behavior by comparing his preferences to those of other users with the same preferences for a given context. This will help the user to adopt the best action when facing a new situation in his itinerary search. This will help the user adopt the best action facing a new situation. Personalized information retrieval is processed based on criteria which weights are determined using the two-additive Choquet integral. The performance of the proposed algorithm was assessed by solving a real-life itinerary planning problem defined in the Tunisian urban public transit network. A comparison study involving both qualitative and quantitative assessment of the proposed approach as compared to two other methods was also carried out. Based on the performance analysis, as well as the comparison study, our new approach provides the best solutions for applications requiring personalization based user’s preferences in a multi-criteria setting.}

First, we analyze the retrieval of intra-day trend for traffic flow series and determine whether this retrieval process improves traffic prediction. We compare different highway traffic prediction models that use either the original traffic flow series or the residual time series with the intra-day trend removed. Test results indicate that the prediction performance MAY be significantly improved in the latter scenario. Second, we address two other related questions: the influence of missing data and traffic breakdown prediction. We show that the Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) method, which also utilizes the intra-day trend of traffic flow series, can be a useful tool in imputing the missing data. It can simultaneously ensure that the prediction error remains at an acceptable level, especially when the missing ratio is relatively low. We also show that almost all the known predictors have hidden assumptions of smoothness and, thus, cannot predict the burst points that deviate too far from the intra-day trend. As a result, traffic breakdown points can only be identified but not predicted.}

ERTMS is composed of two main subsystems which include GSM-R, a radio system for enabling communication between the train and the traffic management center and ETCS, an automatic train protection system (ATP) to replace the existing national ATP systems. The ERTMS specifications are defined by means of standard documents which set out the requirements ensuring interoperability. These documents evolve regularly to give rise to successive versions. The ERTMS/ETCS standard defines different levels and operation modes according to various trackside and onboard setups and some operational conditions. Given the complexity and the high criticality of railway operation, verification and validation (V&V) are crucial tasks in railway application development. In this paper, after setting the background and the motivations, a mechanizable formalization of a subset of ERTMS/ETCS specifications relative to ETCS modes and transitions is developed. The present work aims to offer a readily available model for formal V&V. Using formal techniques to check SRS is highly recommended to tackle the complexity of the defined requirements and prevent specification errors. Model-checking technique, which is targeted here, offers exhaustive analysis of the system behavior based on its model and is highly automated, since it is supported by software tools. Based on the last available version of SRS specifications, a progressive process is undertaken to get a formal model which makes explicit the various modes characterized by their respective active functions, as well as the numerous combinations of conditions for switching between modes. The various steps guiding the translation of the SRS literal specifications into a formal model are explained. As will be shown through different examples, the obtained model is a convenient basis to check safety, interoperability and liveness properties.}

In order to achieve this, various variables have been selected to estimate and predict the surrounding human driver's behavior. However, it is still not fully clear what variables mostly contribute to driving behavior prediction at USI. This paper investigates the contribution levels of 13 features of human driver's decision-making at USI using a random forest approach. Thirty skilled driver participants are tested in a real-time driving simulator where the traffic scenarios with merging vehicles were designed in different motion styles to mimic real traffic. The experiment results indicate that the relative distance and velocity between merging vehicles have a wider contribution range (i.e., −0.4 −0.4) than the absolute velocity and distance features (i.e., −0.2 −0.2) to predict driver behavior. The contribution also varies over the selected feature values and driving conditions. This contribution research gains insight in the influence of different variables on driver behavior prediction at USI, thereby assisting researchers in selecting representative features in self-driving applications.}

Introducing Short-term Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (STAM) measures such as minor ground delays or slight speed adjustments applied to a selected number of flights on the day of operations, supports the dDCB process by reducing the traffic complexity and the probability of Air Traffic Controllers interventions. This paper introduces a rolling horizon methodology for detecting concurrence events, analysing their trajectory interdependencies and applying a strategic mitigation measure that shifts the Estimated Take-Off Time (ETOT) within the assigned Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT) window. The methodology proposes a collaborative decision-making process for a better coordination of departures from airports feeding airspace volumes with high air traffic demand. The experimental part of this paper aims at showing the potential benefits of such a STAM procedure by applying the methodology to distribute the demand of a sector located in the London Terminal Manoeuvring Area (LTMA). Experiments have considered regulated traffic scenarios where ETOT were allocated in order to reduce departure time uncertainties. Lastly, it is analysed the impact of the parameters used by the methodology to calculate the mitigation measures: safe separation criteria, look-ahead time and number of coordinated airports.}

However, it is still problematic for private operators to share data with the public due to risks to competitive advantages. A privacy control algorithm is proposed to overcome this key obstacle for private operators sharing complex network-oriented data objects. The algorithm is based on information-theoretic k-anonymity and, using tour data as an example, where an operator’s data is used in conjunction with performance measure accuracy controls to synthesize a set of alternative tours with diffused probabilities for sampling during a query. The algorithm is proven to converge sublinearly toward a constrained maximum entropy under certain asymptotic conditions with measurable gap. Computational experiments verify the applicability to multi-vehicle fleet tour data; they confirm that reverse engineered parameters from the diffused data result in controllable sampling error; and tests conducted on a set of realistic routing records from travel data in Long Island, NY, demonstrate the use of the methodology from both the adversary and user perspectives.}

The problem has recently been attracting a great interest with the proliferation of automated data collection systems such as Smart Card Automated Fare Collection (AFC), which allow researchers to observe individual travel behaviours over a long time period. However, there is a need for an integrated market segmentation method that incorporating both spatial and behavioural features of individual transit passengers. This algorithm also needs to be efficient for large-scale implementation. This paper proposes a new algorithm named Spatial Affinity Propagation (SAP) based on the classical Affinity Propagation algorithm (AP) to enable large-scale spatial transit market segmentation with spatial-behavioural features. SAP segments transit passengers using spatial geodetic coordinates, where passengers from the same segment are located within immediate walking distance; and using behavioural features mined from AFC data. The comparison with AP and popular algorithms in literature shows that SAP provides nearly as good clustering performance as AP while being 52% more efficient in computation time. This efficient framework would enable transit operators to leverage the availability of AFC data to understand the commonalities and heterogeneities among different groups of passengers.}

However, as of now, automated entities do not necessarily outperform human drivers under all circumstances, particularly under certain road and environmental factors such as bright light, heavy rain, poor quality of road and traffic signs, etc. Therefore, in certain conditions it is safer for the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. However, switching control back and forth between the human driver and the automated driving entity may itself pose a short-term, elevated risk, particularly because of the out of the loop (OOTL) issue for humans. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework to determine the optimal driving-entity switching policy between the automated driving entity and the human driver. Specifically, we develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model to prescribe the entity in charge to minimize the expected safety cost of a trip, considering the dynamic changes of the road/environment during the trip. In addition, we develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model to accommodate the fact that the risk posed by the immediate road/environment may only be partially observed. We conduct extensive numerical experiments and thorough sensitivity and robustness analyses, where we also compare the expected safety cost of trips under the optimal and single driving entity policies. In addition, we quantify the risks associated with the policies, as well as the impact of miss-estimating road/environment condition risk level by the driving entities, and provide insights. The proposed frameworks can be used as a policy tool to identify factors that can render a region suitable for level four autonomy.}

The provision of accurate travel time information enables travelers to make smart decisions about departure time, route choice and congestion avoidance. Based on a vast amount of probe vehicle data, this study proposes a simple but efficient pattern-matching method for travel time forecasting. Unlike previous approaches that directly employ travel time as the input variable, the proposed approach resorts to matching large-scale spatiotemporal traffic patterns for multi-step travel time forecasting. Specifically, the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is first employed to extract spatiotemporal traffic features. The Normalized Squared Differences (NSD) between the GLCMs of current and historical datasets serve as a basis for distance measurements of similar traffic patterns. Then, a screening process with a time constraint window is implemented for the selection of the best-matched candidates. Finally, future travel times are forecasted as a negative exponential weighted combination of each candidate’s experienced travel time for a given departure. The proposed approach is tested on Ring 2, which is a 32km urban expressway in Beijing, China. The intermediate procedures of the methodology are visualized by providing an in-depth quantitative analysis on the speed pattern matching and examples of matched speed contour plots. The prediction results confirm the desirable performance of the proposed approach and its robustness and effectiveness in various traffic conditions.}

A combined methodology was developed, comprising of scanline-based trajectory extraction and feature-matching coordinate transformation. A scanline-based trajectory extraction technique is introduced to separate vehicle strands from pavement background on the spatial-temporal diagram by considering color features, gradient features, and motion features. Particular cleaning algorithms for removing static object noises, shadows, and occlusions are also established. Feature-matching coordinate transformation converts the pixel coordinates to the real-world coordinates to generate the physical vehicle trajectory. To evaluate the algorithm, generated trajectory results were compared to the reconstructed version of the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset. 15-min NGSIM video was divided into a 5-min dataset for the calibration and the remaining 10-min data for evaluation. Model parameters calibrated based on the 5-min video data are then applied to the 10-min testing data. Two levels of performance measurements are considered to evaluate both trajectory-level and point-level results. A reference algorithm based on mainstream motion-based detection and tracking methods are used as a baseline algorithm. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed method shows promising trajectory detection results, that on average more than 90% of vehicle trajectories are constructed by the proposed methods from the NGSIM videos. The HASDA model outperforms the reference algorithm and shows superior transferability in the training-testing experiment. Further work needs to be done to improve the algorithm performance against shadows and occlusions by incorporating more intelligent and advanced techniques.}

In addition, the individual need for flexibility should not be impaired through charging control. Further well known influential factors like economic incentives do not seem to have a significant impact in the sample group under scrutiny.

This paper proposes an adaptive traffic signal control system in a CV environment. At the intersection level, an adaptive control model is developed to assign optimal green times by minimizing the total vehicle delay. When the CV penetration rate is low, a method depending on limited CV data is presented to estimate the vehicle arrival information. At the corridor level, a real-time optimization model is formulated to design the dynamic progression plan for critical paths (i.e. paths with high flows). These two optimization models are solved by the dynamic programming technique. A real-world arterial is modeled in VISSIM to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed traffic signal control system. Simulations with various CV penetration rates and demand levels are conducted to compare the proposed system with fixed coordination and adaptive signal control systems. Results indicate that the proposed system outperforms both base systems by reducing 15.67% and 13.81% of the average delay, respectively, when the CV penetration rate is relatively high. Moreover, the proposed system can improve the arterial performance under all tested scenarios with various CV penetration rates and demand levels. Since the tested demand scenarios can reflect the real traffic fluctuations, it can be proved that the proposed control system could be applied in the field to boost the overall traffic efficiency along the arterial.}

abstract = {Travel time is an important index for managers to evaluate the performance of transportation systems and an intuitive measure for travelers to choose routes and departure times. An important part of the literature focuses on predicting instantaneous travel time under recurrent traffic conditions to disseminate traffic information. However, accurate travel time prediction is important for assessing the effects of abnormal traffic conditions and helping travelers make reliable travel decisions under such conditions. This study proposes an online travel time prediction model with emphasis on capturing the effects of anomalies. The model divides a path into short links. A Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) framework is adopted to forecast link travel times based on historical data and real-time measurements. Furthermore, a probabilistic nested delay operator is used to calculate path travel time distributions. To ensure that the algorithm is fast enough for online applications, parallel computation architecture is introduced to overcome the computational burden of the FPCA. Finally, a rolling horizon structure is applied to online travel time prediction. Empirical results for Guangzhou Airport Expressway indicate that the proposed method can capture an abrupt change in traffic state and provide a promising and reliable travel time prediction at both the link and path levels. In the case where the original FPCA is modified for parallelization, accuracy and computational effort are evaluated and compared with those of the sequential algorithm. The proposed algorithm is found to require only a piece rather than a large set of traffic incident records.}

abstract = {It is known that adverse weather conditions can affect driver performance due to reduction in visibility and slippery surface conditions. Lane keeping is one of the main factors that might be affected by weather conditions. Most of the previous studies on lane keeping have investigated driver lane-keeping performance from driver inattention perspective. In addition, the majority of previous lane-keeping studies have been conducted in controlled environments such as driving simulators. Therefore, there is a lack of studies that investigate driver lane-keeping ability considering adverse weather conditions in naturalistic settings. In this study, the relationship between weather conditions and driver lane-keeping performance was investigated using the SHRP2 naturalistic driving data for 141 drivers between 19 and 89 years of age. Moreover, a threshold was introduced to differentiate lane keeping and lane changing in naturalistic driving data. Two lane-keeping models were developed using the logistic regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to better understand factors affecting driver lane-keeping ability considering adverse weather conditions. The results revealed that heavy rain can significantly increase the standard deviation of lane position (SDLP), which is a very widely used method for analyzing lane-keeping ability. It was also found that traffic conditions, driver age and experience, and posted speed limits have significant effects on driver lane-keeping ability. An interesting finding of this study is that drivers have a better lane-keeping ability in roadways with higher posted speed limits. The results from this study might provide better insights into understanding the complex effect of adverse weather conditions on driver behavior.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a bi-partitioning approach using link density data to identify an optimal restricted zone (RZ) in a congested monocentric city to assist with the implementation of area-wide congestion management strategies. A composite similarity measure is developed for each link in the network as a weighted average of a density similarity measure (ensuring homogeneity) and a distance similarity measure (ensuring connectivity and compactness). The resulting similarity matrix is fed into a graph clustering method termed symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to bi-partition the network. To determine the optimal weight as a hyperparameter, we propose a hierarchical search algorithm (HSA) based on the concept of “knee” that is used to find the most significant solution from the Pareto front. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the Melbourne network using a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model. Results show that the methodology (i) can effectively capture the spatial variations of the congestion pattern in the network; (ii) is robust to moderate parameter changes; (iii) can be extended to the time-dependent case and hence inform when to activate the area control; and (iv) can perform relatively well in the presence of missing data. When varying the distance threshold as a design parameter, we can observe how the optimal RZ evolves in space, a feature that is critical to devising a double- or multi-layered RZ for hierarchical control purposes.}

The approach is then used for short-term traffic volume forecasting, utilizing a data set compiled from real-world traffic volume data obtained from the Hampton Roads traffic operations center in Virginia. To assess the accuracy of the SPN approach, its performance is compared to two other approaches, namely a back propagation neural network and a nearest neighbor approach. The transferability of the SPN approach and its ability to forecast for longer time periods into the future is also assessed. The results of the performance testing conducted in this paper demonstrates the superior predictive accuracy and drastically lower computational requirements of the SPN compared to either the neural network or the nearest neighbor approach. The tests also confirm the ability of the SPN to predict traffic volumes for longer time periods into the future, as well as the transferability of the approach to other sites.}

Measures of drivers’ horizontal and vertical gaze dispersion during both conventional and automated (SAE Level 2) driving were compared on approach to such critical events. Using a between-participant design, 60 drivers (15 in each group) experienced automation with one of four screen manipulations: (1) no manipulation, (2) manipulation by light fog, (3) manipulation by heavy fog, and (4) manipulation by heavy fog with a secondary task, which were used to induce varying levels of engagement with the driving task. Results showed that, during automation, drivers’ horizontal gaze was generally more dispersed than that observed during manual driving. Drivers clearly looked around more when their view of the driving scene was completely blocked by an opaque screen in the heavy fog condition. By contrast, horizontal gaze dispersion was (unsurprisingly) more concentrated when drivers performed a visual secondary task, which was overlaid on the opaque screen. However, once the manipulations ceased and an uncertainty alert captured drivers’ attention towards an impending incident, a similar gaze pattern was found for all drivers, with no carry-over effects observed after the screen manipulations. Results showed that drivers’ understanding of the automated system increased as time progressed, and that scenarios that encourage driver gaze towards the road centre are more likely to increase situation awareness during high levels of automation.}

When collaboration between individuals is involved or timetable based public transportation modes are chosen, rescheduling becomes complex. This paper describes a new framework to investigate algorithms for rescheduling at a large scale. The framework allows to explicitly model the information flow between traffic information services and travelers. It combines macroscopic traffic assignment with microscopic simulation of agents adapting their schedules. Perception filtering is introduced to allow for traveler specific interpretation of perceived macroscopic data and for information going unnoticed; perception filters feed person specific short term predictions about the environment required for schedule adaptation. Individuals are assumed to maximize schedule utility. Initial agendas are created by the FEATHERS activity-based schedule generator for mutually independent individuals using an undisturbed loaded transportation network. The new framework allows both actor behavior and external phenomena to influence the transportation network state; individuals interpret the state changes via perception filtering and start adapting their schedules, again affecting the network via updated traffic demand. The first rescheduling mechanism that has been investigated uses marginal utility that monotonically decreases with activity duration and a monotonically converging relaxation algorithm to efficiently determine the new activity timing. The current framework implementation is aimed to support re-timing, re-location and activity re-sequencing; re-routing at the level of the individual however, requires microscopic travel simulation.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of internet based ride-sharing brings great changes to residents' travel and city traffic. However, few studies had employed empirical data to examine the unique travel patterns of internet based ride-sharing trips. In this paper, we compare taxi trip records and internet based ride-sharing trip records provided by DiDi company. Results reveal many interesting findings that had never been reported before. From the viewpoint of service patterns, ride-sharing mainly increases supplies in hot areas and peak hours. By applying a non-negative matrix factorization method, we find that ride-sharing principally serves as an approach for commuting. So, as an effective supplement to traditional taxi service, it regulates spatial and temporal supply-demand imbalance, especially during morning and evening rush periods. From the viewpoint of individual behavior patterns, we use a clustering method to identify two kinds of internet based ride-sharing drivers. The first kind of drivers usually provides ride-sharing along daily home-work commuting. Trips served by these drivers have relatively constant origin-designation (OD) pairs. The second kind of drivers does not serve regularly and roams around the city even in working hours. Therefore, there are no constant OD pairs in their ride-sharing trips. Counterintuitively, we find that home-work commuting drivers account for only a small part of total drivers and they only serve a small number of commuting trips. In addition, internet based ride-sharing is not just traditional hitchhiking worked through mobile internet. We find that internet based ride-sharing drivers intend to make long distance trips, and they intend to detour further to pick up or drop off passengers than traditional hitchhike drivers since they are paid. All these findings are helpful for policy makers at all levels to make informed decisions about deployment of internet based ride-sharing service. This paper also verifies that big data analytics is particularly useful and powerful in the analysis of ride-sharing and taxi service patterns.}

Such data, however, lack semantic information such as the interaction of individuals with the transportation modes available. On the other hand, traditional mobility surveys provide detailed snapshots of the relation between socio-demographic characteristics and choice of transportation modes. Transportation mode detection is currently approached using features such as speed, acceleration and direction either on their own or in combination with GIS data. Combining such information with socio-demographic characteristics of travellers has the potential of offering a richer modelling framework that could facilitate better transportation mode detection using variables such as age and disability. In this paper, we explore the possibility to include both elements of the environment and individual characteristics of travellers in the task of transportation mode detection. Using dynamic Bayesian Networks, we model the transition matrix to account for such auxiliary data by using an informative Dirichlet prior constructed using data from traditional mobility surveys. Results have shown that it is possible to achieve comparable accuracy with the most widely used classification algorithms while having a rich modelling framework, even in the case of sparse mobility data.}

After the simulator session, the participants were interviewed about their experiences of the various constituents of the systems. In general, the participants had a positive attitude towards eco-driving support systems and behavioural data indicated that they tended to comply with the advice given. However, different drivers had very different preferences with respect to what type of information they found useful. The majority of the participants preferred simple and clear information. The eco-driving constituents that were rated as most useful were advice on gas pedal pressure, speed guidance, feedback on manoeuvres, fuel consumption information and simple statistics. It is concluded that customisable user interfaces are recommended for eco-driving support systems for trucks.}

However they still necessitate the recruitment of participants and are thus potentially biased and certainly not encompassing significant parts of the population. Given the high penetration of mobile phones, passive tracking by telephone providers would alleviate those two shortcomings at the cost of reduced sampling frequency and positional accuracy. The trade-off in quality has not yet been quantified and therefore recommendations on sensible thresholds are not yet available. In this study therefore, instead of presenting yet another method for mode of transport classification, we therefore compare the performance of existing mode detection schemes under deteriorating sampling rates and positional accuracies. As a possibility to compensate for the deteriorating signal we also calculate features from users’ positional histories that could be beneficial if their behaviour is repetitive. The evaluation is not only based on pointwise accuracy, but includes quality measures that pertain to trips as a whole. We find that the necessary accuracy and sampling rate for applications will depend on whether the information of whole trajectories can be used, or whether only the current information is available. The former being relevant to ex-post analyses while the latter situation appears more frequently in near-time analyses. For segmentwise classification, there is no major impact on the quality of the classification by the tested levels of spatial accuracies as long as the sampling intervals can be kept at or below a minute, whereas for point based classification the sampling interval should be between 30 s and a minute and increasing spatial accuracy always improves the classification.}

The proposed methodology has been developed and tested in several driving sessions executed in two highly realistic simulators by several professional and non-professional drivers. The driver’s hand positions are used to feed a risk buffer that is in charge of penalizing wrong hands activities and praising good hands activities to generate a measure of the driving risk. In addition, other relevant variables are considered to increase the risk level (activators) or decrease the risk level (inhibitors) depending on the driving situations. In order to estimate the parameters of the risk buffer, a genetic algorithm (GA) and a driving risk ground truth acquired from traffic safety experts were considered. Several experiments have been designed and executed in truck and vehicle simulators. The proposed methodology has been tested in different driving scenarios. On the one hand, our method provides an estimation of the most relevant variables used for the traffic safety experts to define the driving risk. On the other hand, our method shows its effectiveness to automatically detect risky situations related to bad driver’s behavior. In the future, the present system will be integrated in a global alarm system that will be included in real vehicles for the improvement of traffic safety.}

Processing big GPS trajectory data, consisting of billions of GPS waypoints and millions of individual trajectories is a challenging yet important task for researchers from these different domains. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark-based geo-computing framework for using big GPS trajectory data to estimate vehicle miles travelled, an important metric used by both federal and state highway agencies in the United States for transportation planning. The computing challenge lies in scaling the processing of billions of raw GPS points data as well as the steps for map matching for a statewide road network consisting of thousands of road segments. In this work, we develop a scalable map-matching module that considers both the spatiotemporal information of GPS waypoint sequences and topologic information of road network for the State of Maryland while striking a balance between matching accuracy and computing time. We processed 19.8 million raw GPS trips consisting of approximately 1.4 billion GPS waypoints collected in Maryland during a four-month period in 2015 to estimate vehicle miles travelled for Maryland’s road network. The estimation results show that using big GPS trajectory analytic methods is promising for obtaining accurate and stable vehicle miles travelled estimates.}

abstract = {Development of a universal freeway incident detection algorithm is a task that remains unfulfilled despite the promising approaches that have been recently explored. Incident detection researchers are realizing that an operationally successful detection framework needs to fulfill a full set of recognized needs. In this paper we attempt to define one possible set of universality requirements. Among the set of requirements, a freeway incident detection algorithm needs to be operationally accurate and transferable. Guided by the envisioned requirements, we introduce a new algorithm with potential for enhanced performance. The algorithm is a modified form of the Bayesian-based Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) that utilizes the concept of statistical distance. The paper is divided into three main sections. The first section is a detailed definition of the attributes and capabilities that a potentially universal freeway incident detection framework should possess. The second section discusses the training and testing of the PNN. In the third section, we evaluate the PNN relative to the universality template previously defined. In addition to a large set of simulated incidents, we utilize a fairly large real incident databases from the I-880 freeway in California and the I-35W in Minnesota to comparatively evaluate the performance and transferability of different algorithms, including the PNN. Experimental results indicate that the new PNN-based algorithm is competitive with the Multi Layer Feed Forward (MLF) architecture, which was found in previous studies to yield superior incident detection performance, while being significantly faster to train. In addition, results also point to the possibility of utilizing the real-time learning capability of this new architecture to produce a transferable incident detection algorithm without the need for explicit off-line retraining in the new site. In this respect, and unlike existing algorithms, the PNN has been found to markedly improve in performance with time in service as it retrains itself on captured incident data, verified by the Traffic Management Center (TMC) operator. Moreover, the overall PNN-based framework promises potential enhancements towards the envisioned universality requirements.}

We discuss the psychological factors underlying the question of how safe AVs need to be to compel consumers away from relying on the abilities of human drivers. For consumers, how safe is safe enough? Three preregistered studies (N = 4566) reveal that the established psychological biases of algorithm aversion and the better-than-average effect leave consumers averse to adopting AVs unless the cars meet extremely potentially unrealistically high safety standards. Moreover, these biases prove stubbornly hard to overcome, and risk substantially delaying the adoption of life-saving autonomous driving technology. We end by proposing that, from a psychological perspective, the emphasis AV advocates have put on safety may be misplaced.}

This work assumes that the APTVs of a single line are controlled centrally and are responsive to real-time requests from passengers. As the result, a real-time schedule can be constructed and communicated to the passengers. However, during the actual operations, the real-time demand will be fluctuated entailing schedule adjustments. These adjustments are optimized in this work using two operational strategies for the APTVs: holding and speed changing. The solution methodology proposed is based on time-space graphical techniques using multi-criteria decision analysis to minimize schedule changes as the primary objective, as well as to reduce travel time and active energy consumption. Two multi-objective models are developed for not-considered and considered vehicle capacity and then examined using a simulation framework. A case study from Auckland, New Zealand, is selected, which assumes that ordinary buses are replaced with APTVs. The results indicate that the strategy-based optimal schedule adjustments achieve a 100% elimination of schedule deviations compared with 33-minute and 13-minute deviations for the low-demand and high-demand scenarios of the ordinary PT service, respectively. The results of the simulated case study indicate that the incorporation of APTVs, along with prudent control, can result in a more attractive PT service.}

In transportation, although it has been used to assist some design and planning works, the application has been predominantly focused on autonomous vehicles, regardless of its great potential in precise detection and tracking of all road users if implemented in the field. This paper explores fundamental concepts, solution algorithms, and application guidance associated with using infrastructure-based LiDAR sensors to accurately detect and track pedestrians and vehicles at intersections. Based on LiDAR data collected in the field, investigations were conducted in the order of background filtering, object clustering, pedestrian and vehicle classification, and tracking. The results of the analysis include accurate and real-time information of the presence, position, velocity, and direction of pedestrians and vehicles. By studying the data from infrastructure-mounted LiDAR sensors at intersections, this paper offers insights into some critical techniques that are valuable to both researchers and practitioners toward field implementation of LiDAR sensors.}

However, research has found that it considers redundant prediction errors of component predictors when calculating their credits, which makes it quite impervious to the fluctuated accuracy of the component predictors. To address this problem, a new BCM has been developed here to improve the performance of the traditional BCM. It assumes that at one prediction interval, the traffic flow is correlated with the traffic flows of only a few previous intervals. With this assumption, the credits of the component predictors in the BCM are only accounted for by their prediction performance for a few intervals rather than for all intervals. Therefore, compared with the traditional BCM, the new BCM is more sensitive to the perturbed performance of the component predictors and can adjust their credits more rapidly, and better predictions are generated as a result. To analyze the relevancy between the historical traffic flows and the traffic flow at the current interval, the entropy-based grey relation analysis method is proposed in detail. Three single predictors, namely the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Kalman filter (KF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) are designed and incorporated linearly into the BCM to take advantage of each method. A numerical application demonstrates that the new BCM considerably outperforms the traditional BCM both in terms of accuracy and stability.}

This article proposes a freeway travel time prediction framework that exhibits both qualities. The framework exploits a recurrent neural network topology, the so-called state-space neural network (SSNN), with preprocessing strategies based on imputation. Although the SSNN model is a neural network, its design (in terms of input- and model selection) is not “black box” nor location-specific. Instead, it is based on the lay-out of the freeway stretch of interest. In this sense, the SSNN model combines the generality of neural network approaches, with traffic related (“white-box”) design. Robustness to missing data is tackled by means of simple imputation (data replacement) schemes, such as exponential forecasts and spatial interpolation. Although there are clear theoretical shortcomings to “simple” imputation schemes to remedy input failure, our results indicate that their use is justified in this particular application. The SSNN model appears to be robust to the “damage” done by these imputation schemes. This is true for both incidental (random) and structural input failure. We demonstrate that the SSNN travel time prediction framework yields good accurate and robust travel time predictions on both synthetic and real data.}

Many researchers have already developed various methods that predict the future traffic condition from the historical database. Nevertheless, there has not been sufficient effort made to study how to identify and utilize the different factors that affect the traffic flow. In order to improve the performance of short-term traffic flow prediction, it is necessary to consider sufficient information related to the road section to be predicted. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing traffic state vectors by using mutual information (MI). First, the variables with different time delays are generated from the historical traffic time series, and the spatio-temporal correlations between the road sections in urban road network are evaluated by the MI. Then, the variables with the highest correlation related to the target traffic flow are selected by using a greedy search algorithm to construct the traffic state vector. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model is adapted for the application of the proposed state vector. Experimental results on real-world traffic data show that the proposed method of constructing traffic state vector provides good prediction accuracy in short-term traffic prediction.}

In this study, we propose a unified framework to design, optimize and analyze MoD operations within a multimodal transportation system where the demand for a travel mode is a function of its level of service. An application of Bayesian optimization (BO) to derive the optimal supply-side MoD parameters (e.g., fleet size and fare) is also illustrated. The proposed framework is calibrated using the taxi demand data in Manhattan, New York. Travel demand is served by public transit and MoD services of varying passenger capacities (1, 4 and 10), and passengers are predicted to choose travel modes according to a mode choice model. This choice model is estimated using stated preference data collected in New York City. The convergence of the multimodal supply-demand system and the superiority of the BO-based optimization method over earlier approaches are established through numerical experiments. We finally consider a policy intervention where the government imposes a tax on the ride-hailing service and illustrate how the proposed framework can quantify the pros and cons of such policies for different stakeholders.}

Typical GPS data does not provide detailed activity information for a given stop or vehicle movement. We categorize stop events into two types: (1) primary stops where goods are transferred and (2) secondary stops where vehicle and driver needs are met, such as rest stations. The proposed entropy technique measures the diversity of truck carriers with trucks that dwell for 15min or longer at a given location. Larger entropy arises from a greater variety of carriers and an even distribution of stop events among these carriers. An analysis confirms our initial hypothesis that the stop locations used for secondary purposes such as fuel refills and rest breaks tend to have higher entropy, reflecting the diversity of trucks and carriers that use these facilities. Conversely, primary shipping depots and other locations where goods are transferred tend to have lower entropy due to the lower variety of carriers that utilize such locations.}

abstract = {Existing methods for calibrating link fundamental diagrams (FDs) often focus on a limited number of links and use grouping strategies that are largely dependent on roadway physical attributes alone. In this study, we propose a big data-driven two-stage clustering framework to calibrate link FDs for freeway networks. The first stage captures, under normal traffic state, the variations of link FDs over multiple days based on which links are clustered in the second stage. Two methods, i.e. the standard k-means algorithm combined with hierarchical clustering and a modified hierarchical clustering based on the Fréchet distance, are applied in the first stage to obtain the FD parameter matrix for each link. The calibrated matrices are input into the second stage where the modified hierarchical clustering is re-employed asa static approach resulting in multiple clusters of links. To further consider the variations of link FDs, the static approach is extended by modifying the similarity measure through the principle component analysis (PCA). The resulting multivariate time-series clustering models the distributions of the FD parameters asa dynamic approach. The proposed framework is applied on the Melbourne freeway network using one-year worth of loop detector data. Results have shown that (a) similar roadway physical attributes do not necessarily result in similar link FDs, (b) the connectivity-based approach performs better in clustering link FDs as compared with the centroid-based approach, and (c) the proposed framework helps achieving a better understanding of the spatial distribution of links with similar FDs and the associated variations and distributions of the FD parameters.}

In this paper, we investigate the optimization problem for pricing managed lanes with multiple entrances and exits which seeks to maximize the revenue and minimize the total system travel time (TSTT) over a finite horizon. We propose a lane choice model where travelers make online decisions at each diverge point considering all routes on a managed lane network. We formulate the problem as a deterministic Markov decision process and solve it using the value function approximation (VFA) method for different initializations. We compare the performance of the toll policies predicted by the VFA method against the myopic revenue policy which maximizes the revenue only at the current timestep and two heuristic policies based on the measured densities on the managed and general purpose lanes (GPLs). We test the results on four different test networks. The primary findings from our research suggest the usefulness of the VFA method for determining dynamic tolls. The best-found objective value from the method at its termination is better than other heuristics for all test networks with average improvements in the objective ranging between 10% and 90% for revenue maximization and 0–27% for TSTT minimization. Certain VFA initializations obtain best-found toll profiles within first 5–50 iterations which warrants computational time savings. Our findings also indicate that the revenue-maximizing optimal policies follow the “jam-and-harvest” behavior where the GPLs are pushed towards congestion in the earlier time steps to generate higher revenue in the later time steps, a characteristic not observed for the policies minimizing TSTT.}

Here, any obstacle (neighboring entity on the road) to the subject vehicle is treated as a finite scalar risk field that is formulated in the predicted configuration space of the subject vehicle. The driving risk estimate is the strength of the risk field at the subject vehicle’s future location. This risk field is formulated as the product of two factors: collision probability and expected crash energy. The collision probability with neighboring vehicles is estimated based on probabilistic motion predictions. The risk can be assessed for a single time step or over multiple future time steps, depending on the required temporal resolution of the estimates. We verified the single step approach in three near-crash situations from a naturalistic dataset and in cut-in and hard-braking scenarios with simulation and showed the application of the multi-step approach in selecting the safest path in a lane-drop section. The risk descriptions from the proposed approach qualitatively reflect the narration of the situation and are in general consistent with Time To Collision. Compared to current surrogate measures of safety, the proposed risk estimate provides a better basis to assess the driving safety of an individual vehicle by considering the uncertainty over the future ambient traffic state and magnitude of expected crash consequences. The proposed driving risk model can be used as a component of intelligent vehicle safety applications and as a comprehensive surrogate measure for assessing traffic safety.}

In this paper it is demonstrated how to adapt an existing multi-agent transportation simulation framework to large-scale pedestrian evacuation simulation. The underlying flow model simulates the traffic-based on a simple queue model where only free speed, bottleneck capacities, and space constraints are taken into account. The queue simulation, albeit simple, captures the most important aspects of evacuations such as the congestion effects of bottlenecks and the time needed to evacuate the endangered area. In the case of an evacuation simulation the network has time-dependent attributes. For instance, large-scale inundations or conflagrations do not cover all the endangered area at once. These time-dependent attributes are modeled as network change events. Network change events are modifying link parameters at predefined points in time. The simulation framework is demonstrated through a case study for the Indonesian city of Padang, which faces a high risk of being inundated by a tsunami.}

The improvement centers on the use of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to assess the similarity between two given time series, instead of using the Euclidean Distance as was the case with the original SPN. Following this, the enhanced method (i.e., hereafter referred to as the DTW–SPN) is used to predict hourly traffic volumes at the Peace Bridge, an international border crossing connecting Western New York State in the U.S. and Southern Ontario in Canada. The performance of the DTW–SPN is then compared to that of three other forecasting methods, namely: (1) the original SPN (referred to as the Euclidean–SPN); (2) the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) method; and (3) Support Vector Regression (SVR). Both classified as well as non-classified datasets are utilized, with the classification made on the basis of the type of the day to which the data items belong (i.e. Mondays through Thursdays, Fridays, weekends, holidays, and game days). The results indicate that, in terms of the Mean Absolute Percent Error, the DTW–SPN performed the best for all data groups with the exception of the “game day” group, where SVR performed slightly better. From a computational efficiency standpoint, the SPN-type algorithms require runtime significantly lower than that for either SARIMA or SVR. The performance of the DTW–SPN was also quite acceptable even when the data was not classified, indicating the robustness of the proposed forecasting method in dealing with heterogeneous data.}

The goal of this paper is to extend and complement the previous published studies. It reports an extended analysis of the research results, highlighting and elaborating the challenges that need to be addressed before a large-scale application of the framework can take place. The focus is specifically on the automatic harvesting of relevant, valuable information from Twitter. The results from automatically mining transport related messages in two scenarios are presented i.e. with a small-scale labelled dataset and with a large-scale dataset of 3.7m tweets. Tweets authored by individuals that mention a need for transport, express an opinion about transport services or report an event, with respect to different transport modes, were mined. The challenges faced in automatically analysing Twitter messages, written in Twitter’s specific language, are illustrated. The results presented show a strong degree of success in the identification of transport related tweets, with similar success in identifying tweets that expressed an opinion about transport services. The identification of tweets that expressed a need for transport services or reported an event was more challenging, a finding mirrored during the human based message annotation process. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of automatic extraction of valuable information from tweets while pointing to areas where challenges were encountered and additional research is needed. The impact of a successful solution to these challenges (thereby creating efficient harvesting systems) would be to enable travellers to participate more effectively in the improvement of transport services.}

The beneficial computational properties of the algorithm arise from casting the ridesharing problem as a linear assignment problem between fleet vehicles and customer trip requests within a federated optimization architecture. The resulting algorithm is up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art, even if it is implemented on a less dedicated hardware, and achieves similar service quality. Current literature showcases the ability of state-of-the-art ridesharing algorithms to tackle very large fleets and customer requests in almost near real-time, but the benefits of ridesharing seem limited to centralized systems. Our algorithm suggests that this does not need to be the case. The algorithm that we propose is fully distributable among multiple ridesharing companies. By leveraging two datasets, the New York city taxi dataset and the Melbourne Metropolitan Area dataset, we show that with our algorithm, real-time ridesharing offers clear benefits with respect to more traditional taxi fleets in terms of level of service, even if one considers partial adoption of the system. In fact, e.g., the quality of the solutions obtained in the state-of-the-art works that tackle the whole customer set of the New York city taxi dataset is achieved, even if one considers only a proportion of the fleet size and customer requests. This could make real-time urban-scale ridesharing very attractive to small enterprises and city authorities alike. However, in some cases, e.g., in multi-company scenarios where companies have predefined market shares, we show that the number of vehicles needed to achieve a comparable performance to the monopolistic setting increases, and this raises concerns on the possible negative effects of multi-company ridesharing.}

It is generally expected to improve vehicle utilization rate, and therefore alleviate traffic congestion and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. A few recent theoretical studies are conducted, mainly focusing on the equilibrium analysis of the ride-sourcing markets with ride-pooling services and the impacts of ride-pooling services on transit ridership and traffic congestion. In these studies, there are three key measures that distinguish ride-pooling service analysis from the non-pooling ride-sourcing market analysis. The first is the proportion of passengers who are pool-matched(referred to as pool-matching probability), the second is passengers’ average detour distance, and the third is average vehicle routing distance to pick up and drop off all passengers with different origins and destinations in one specific ride. These three measures are determined by passenger demand for ride-pooling and matching strategies. However, due to the complex nature of ride-resourcing market, it is difficult to analytically determine the relationships between these measures and passenger demand. To fill this research gap, this paper attempts to empirically ascertain these relationships through extensive experiments based on the actual on-demand mobility data obtained from Chengdu, Haikou, and Manhattan. We are surprised to find that the relationships between the three measures (pool-matching probability, passengers’ average detour distance, average vehicle routing distance) and number of passengers in the matching pool (which reflects passenger demand) can be fitted by some simple curves (with fairly high goodness-of-fit) or there exist elegant empirical laws on these relationships. Our findings are insightful and useful to theoretical modeling and applications in ride-resourcing markets, such as evaluation of the impacts of ride-pooling on transit usage and traffic congestion.}

However, previous methods of pedestrian volume collection require either time-consuming ground-truth data collection, or the purchase and maintenance of costly sensors in a large-scale application. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method for large-scale pedestrian estimation at midblock crosswalks using button-pushing and signal timing events. The pedestrian arrival is modeled as a Poisson process, and two submethods are developed to estimate pedestrian volume at one-stage and two-stage button-activated midblock crosswalks (BAMCs). To address the issue of missing signal cycles at two-stage BAMCs, all missing cycles that are identified by using the proposed paired signal cycle identification algorithm are accounted for and added by minimizing the error between estimation results of two stages. Eight days of the ground-truth pedestrian volume is manually collected from two study midblock crosswalks to evaluate the proposed methods. On average, 235 and 230 pedestrians per day were observed to cross the one-stage BAMC and two-stage BAMC, respectively. The average mean absolute error of estimated pedestrian volume using a one-hour interval is 2.27 and 1.78 ped/hour at two study locations, respectively. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed methods are promising for estimating pedestrian volume at midblock crosswalks using event-based data. A further sensitivity analysis of changing the estimation interval shows that the one-hour interval pedestrian volume estimation is recommended as having the least error.}

Green driving, whether motivated by financial or environmental savings, has the potential to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by a significant amount. This paper focusses on the interaction between the driver and their vehicle – what type of eco-driving information is easy to use and learn whilst not compromising safety. A simulator study evaluated both visual and haptic eco-driving feedback systems in the context of hill driving. The ability of drivers to accurately follow the advice, as well as their propensity to prioritise it over safe driving was investigated. We found that any type of eco-driving advice improved performance and whilst continuous real-time visual feedback proved to be the most effective, this modality obviously reduces attention to the forward view and increases subjective workload. On the other hand, the haptic force system had little effect on reported workload, but was less effective that the visual system. A compromise may be a hybrid system that adapts to drivers’ performance on an on-going basis.}

Three eco-driving interfaces were selected for test (a second-order display visual display with auditory alerts and two haptic accelerator pedal systems) following a pilot study of 12 different interfaces. These systems were tested in a range of eco-driving scenarios involving acceleration, deceleration and speed maintenance, and assessed through their effects on fuel economy, vehicle control, distraction, and driver subjective feedback. The results suggest that a haptic accelerator pedal system is most effective for preventing over-acceleration, whilst minimal differences were observed between systems in terms of the effect of the assistance provided to prevent under-acceleration. The visual–auditory interface lowered the time spent looking towards the road, indicating a potential negative impact on driver safety from using this modality to provide continuous green driving support. Subjective results were consistent with the objective findings, with haptic pedal systems creating lower perceived workload than a visual–auditory interface. Driver acceptability ratings suggested a slight favouring of a haptic-force system for its usefulness, whereas the more subtle haptic-stiffness system was judged more acceptable to use. These findings offer suggestions for the design of a user-friendly, eco-driving device that can help drivers improve their fuel economy, specifically through the provision of real-time guidance on the manipulation of the accelerator pedal position.}

To solve this problem, numerous algorithms had been proposed in the last decade to impute the missed data. However, few existing studies had fully used the traffic flow information of neighboring detecting points to improve imputing performance. In this paper, probabilistic principle component analysis (PPCA) based imputing method, which had been proven to be one of the most effective imputing methods without using temporal or spatial dependence, is extended to utilize the information of multiple points. We systematically examine the potential benefits of multi-point data fusion and study the possible influence of measurement time lags. Tests indicate that the hidden temporal–spatial dependence is nonlinear and could be better retrieved by kernel probabilistic principle component analysis (KPPCA) based method rather than PPCA method. Comparison proves that imputing errors can be notably reduced, if temporal–spatial dependence has been appropriately considered.}

The wearable device is responsible to acquire selected biosignals, pre-process them and wirelesses transmit them from the subject-site to the centralized system. The centralized system, which is the main part of the system and carries most of the processing, has a twofold purpose: on the one hand it performs evaluation of the subject’s emotional state and on the other hand it projects a generic 3D face model whereat the facial expression of the subject can be viewed. A two stage classification scheme is used. First a decision tree is implemented in order to classify the subject’s emotional state as high stress, low stress and valence. Then a Tree Augmented Naïve Bayesian classifier (TAN) is used to classify valence as euphoria and dysphoria. The centralized system has been validated using a dataset obtained from ten subjects in simulated racing conditions. The emotional classes identified are high stress, low stress, dysphoria and euphoria. The overall classification rate achieved using tenfold cross-validation is high. AUBADE constitutes the first system which has the feasibility of remote and real time affective assessment in car racing, providing a useful addition to the existing telemetry systems used in the domain.}

Our method follows the procedure of finding feature correspondences from consecutive frames and minimizing its re-projection error. Firstly, we propose an image singular value decomposition algorithm to mitigate the impact of picture blurring. Secondly, a statistic filter of feature space displacement and a circle matching method are proposed to screen or prune potential matched features so as to remove the outliers caused by the mismatching. Thirdly, experiments are conducted on a benchmark dataset KITTI and real outdoor and indoor image data with blur, weak texture or illumination changes to verify the validation of the proposed algorithm. Lastly, the proposed algorithm is successfully applied to indoor parking guidance. The results demonstrate that compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed video-based vehicle ego-positioning scheme has more precise and reliable performance with a lower cost, which provides an appropriate way for indoor parking guidance.}

abstract = {Automated monitoring of pedestrians on non-motorized facilities with high pedestrian flows is challenging. Several automated sensor solutions are commercially available that have been evaluated in the literature including traditional point-based sensors, such as inductive loop detectors for bicycles and infrared sensors for pedestrians. More recently, image-based systems, based on video cameras or thermal video cameras, have been developed. Despite the various options, some key limitations of existing solutions exist, in particular, the lack of low-cost solutions using embedded systems capable of performing in real-time under high volume (flow) conditions. This work aims at developing and evaluating the performance of a novel, real-time counting system, developed for environments with high pedestrian flows. The proposed system is based on emerging LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology. As an input, the system uses the distance measurements from a two-dimensional LiDAR sensor with a set of distinct laser channels and a given angular resolution between each channel. The developed system processes those measurements using a clustering algorithm to detect, count, and identify the direction of travel of each pedestrian. The system’s performance is evaluated by comparing its directional counting outputs with manual counts (ground truth) using disaggregate and aggregate (15-minutes interval) counts at two different monitoring locations. The results demonstrate that the system accurately counts more than 97% of the pedestrians at the disaggregate level, with a false direction detection rate of 1.1%. The over-counting error is 0.7% and the under-counting errors are 1.3% and 2.7% for the two selected sites. At the aggregate level (15-minutes interval), the average absolute percentage deviations (AAPDs) are 1.6% and 4.3% while the weighted AAPDs are 1.5% and 3.5% for the first and second sites, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed system is higher than the traditional technologies used for the same purpose.}

Software is the key driving factor underpinning autonomy within which planning algorithms that are responsible for mission-critical decision making hold a significant position. While transporting passengers or goods from a given origin to a given destination, motion planning methods incorporate searching for a path to follow, avoiding obstacles and generating the best trajectory that ensures safety, comfort and efficiency. A range of different planning approaches have been proposed in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to review existing approaches and then compare and contrast different methods employed for the motion planning of autonomous on-road driving that consists of (1) finding a path, (2) searching for the safest manoeuvre and (3) determining the most feasible trajectory. Methods developed by researchers in each of these three levels exhibit varying levels of complexity and performance accuracy. This paper presents a critical evaluation of each of these methods, in terms of their advantages/disadvantages, inherent limitations, feasibility, optimality, handling of obstacles and testing operational environments. Based on a critical review of existing methods, research challenges to address current limitations are identified and future research directions are suggested so as to enhance the performance of planning algorithms at all three levels. Some promising areas of future focus have been identified as the use of vehicular communications (V2V and V2I) and the incorporation of transport engineering aspects in order to improve the look-ahead horizon of current sensing technologies that are essential for planning with the aim of reducing the total cost of driverless vehicles. This critical review on planning techniques presented in this paper, along with the associated discussions on their constraints and limitations, seek to assist researchers in accelerating development in the emerging field of autonomous vehicle research.}

However, RSS’s performance has not yet been tested with real driving data. This study thus calibrates and evaluates the RSS model based on car-following scenarios created from safety-critical events (SCEs) detected in the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. SCEs were identified from the raw data with a trigger method; they were manually validated and then converted into virtual scenarios in which the human-driven subject vehicle was replaced with an AV controlled by a model predictive control based adaptive cruise control (ACC) system embedded with RSS. The RSS model was calibrated with the goal of achieving optimal safety performance, that is, of generating the lowest time-integrated time-to-collision (TIT) after the AV algorithms were implemented in the safety-critical scenarios. By comparing the performance of RSS-embedded ACC, ACC-only, and the unassisted human driver, this study found that: 1) RSS-embedded ACC performed best in eliminating underlying safety-critical situations by controlling the average TIT for each 15-second event at 2.65 s2; 2) RSS-embedded ACC generated the highest average relative speed and relative distance, and the lowest standard deviation of speed; and 3) on average, RSS-embedded ACC was able to perceive the SCEs 2.31 s ahead of the human driver.}

The unsupervised clustering groups the actions of the driver based on the relative motion detected using a skin-color segmentation algorithm, while the activity classifier is a binary Bayesian eigenimage classifier. Activities are grouped as safe or unsafe and the results of the classification are shown on several subjects obtained from two distinct driving video sequences.}

In this paper, we present a semiparametric regression modelling framework to determine the underlying drivers of journey time variance in urban metro systems, using the London Underground as a case study. We merge train location and passenger trip data to decompose total journey times into three constituent parts: access times as passengers enter the system, on-train times, and egress times as passengers exit at their destinations. For each journey time component, we estimate non-linear functional relationships which we then use to derive elasticity estimates of journey times with respect to service supply and demand factors, including operational and physical characteristics of metros as well as passenger demand and passenger-specific travel characteristics. We find that the static fixed physical characteristics of stations and routes have the greatest influence on journey time, followed by train speeds, and headways, for which the average elasticities of total journey time are −0.54 and 0.05, respectively. The results of our analysis could inform operators about where potential interventions should be targeted in order to improve journey time performance.}

Two types of pressure measures, including an endogenous and an exogenous pressure, are defined. The endogenous pressure is associated with the estimated exit-flow during a signal phase in the next time period, while the exogenous pressure is a virtual pressure associated with the downstream links. The properties of the proposed signal control strategy, including localized waiting time minimization and queue length stabilization at each isolated intersection were discussed. The performance of the proposed signal control strategy was evaluated with two testing networks via simulation, including a network with an isolated signalized intersection and a network with multiple signalized intersections. We compared the performance of the proposed DP control strategy with three existing strategies, including the fixed signal control, adaptive signal control and a back-pressure algorithm based control strategy proposed by previous studies. The test results show promise of the proposed DP control strategy in improving network travel time and queue stability when compared with several state-of-art decentralized control strategies, even though we acknowledge that future efforts in extending the decentralized strategy towards a better system-wide coordination are warranted.}

In this paper, we propose a data-driven AID framework that can leverage large-scale historical traffic data along with the inherent topology of the traffic networks to obtain robust traffic patterns. Such traffic patterns can be compared with the real-time traffic data to detect traffic incidents in the road network. Our AID framework consists of two basic steps for traffic pattern estimation. First, we estimate a robust univariate speed threshold using historical traffic information from individual sensors. This step can be parallelized using MapReduce framework thereby making it feasible to implement the framework over large networks. Our study shows that such robust thresholds can improve incident detection performance significantly compared to traditional threshold determination. Second, we leverage the knowledge of the topology of the road network to construct threshold heatmaps and perform image denoising to obtain spatio-temporally denoised thresholds. We used two image denoising techniques, bilateral filtering and total variation for this purpose. Our study shows that overall AID performance can be improved significantly using bilateral filter denoising compared to the noisy thresholds or thresholds obtained using total variation denoising.}

One of the key applications of such a system is in the prediction and avoidance of collisions between vehicles. If a method to do this is to succeed it must be robust to measurement uncertainty and to loss of communication links. The method should also be general enough that it does not rely on constraints on vehicle motion for the accuracy of its predictions. It should work for all interactions between vehicles and not just a select subset. This paper presents a method to calculate Time to Collision for unconstrained vehicle motion. This metric is gated using a novel technique based on relative vehicle motion that we call “looming”. Finally, these ideas are integrated into a probabilistic framework that accounts for uncertainty in vehicle state and loss of vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Together this work represents a new way of considering vehicle collision estimation. These algorithms are validated on data collected from real world vehicle trials.}

Such control concept needs to be tested by simulations, hence, it is necessary to develop a model that can appropriately estimate the network-wide flow dynamics. In this paper, agent-based network transmission model (ANTM) is proposed for describing the aggregated flow dynamics over an urban area of multiple large-scale networks. The proposed model is the combination of the cell transmission model (CTM), macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), and agent concept. The CTM-based simulation is adopted for the simplicity considering the computation requirements for real-time feasibility. The MFD concept is applied for representing the network properties, and a new approach is taken particularly for estimating network outflow affected by both demand patterns and boundary capacity. The agent concept is applied for representing drivers’ travel behaviors. The model is compared with microscopic simulations and shows reasonable accuracy for large areas. In addition, various travel direction choice behaviors are applicable to this model. Various perimeter control policies are applicable as well, thus, the proposed model can be a useful tool for testing various control methods, in terms of reducing the congestion in urban areas.}

If drivers are prepared to change their driving habits they can complete the same journeys within similar travel times, but using significantly less fuel. In this paper, a prototype fuel-efficiency support tool is presented which helps drivers make the necessary behavioural adjustments. The support tool includes a normative model that back-calculates the minimal fuel consumption for manoeuvres carried out. If actual fuel consumption deviates from this optimum, the support tool presents advice to the driver on how to change his or her behaviour. To take account of the temporal nature of the driving task, advice is generated at two levels: tactical and strategic. Evaluation of the new support tool by means of a driving simulator experiment revealed that drivers were able to reduce overall fuel consumption by 16% compared with ‘normal driving’. The same drivers were only able to achieve a reduction of 9% when asked to drive fuel efficiently without support; thus, the tool gave an additional reduction of 7%. Within a simulated urban environment, the additional reduction yielded by the support tool rose to 14%. The new support tool was also evaluated with regard to secondary effects.}

Fortunately, the framework around the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) provides an efficient description of network-wide traffic performance. In this paper, we show how temporal patterns of vehicle traffic define the performance of urban road networks. We present two high-resolution traffic datasets covering a year each. We introduce a methodology to quantify the similarity of macroscopic traffic patterns. We do so by using the concepts of the MFD and a dynamic time warping (DTW) based algorithm for time series. This allows us to derive a few representative MFD clusters that capture the essential macroscopic traffic patterns. We then provide an in-depth analysis of traffic heterogeneity in the network which is indicative of the previously found clusters. Thereupon, we define a parsimonious classification approach to predict the expected MFD clusters early in the morning with high accuracy.}

Normally, the motion control of the vehicle is composed of trajectory planning and trajectory following according to the surrounding risk factors, the vehicles’ capabilities as well as tyre/road interaction situations. However, pure trajectory following with a unique path may make the motion control of the vehicle be too careful and cautious with a large amount of steering effort. To follow a planned trajectory, the AVs with the traditional path-following control algorithms will correct their states even if the vehicles have only a slight deviation from the desired path or the vehicle detects static infrastructure like roadside trees. In this case, the safety of the AVs can be guaranteed to some degree, but the comfort and sense of hazards for the drivers are ignored, and sometimes the AVs have unusual motion behaviours which may not be acceptable to other road users. To solve this problem, this study aims to develop a safety corridor-based vehicle motion control approach by investigating human-driven vehicle behaviour and the vehicle’s dynamic capabilities. The safety corridor is derived by the manoeuvring action feedback of actual drivers as collected in a driving simulator when presented with surrounding risk elements and enables the AVs to have safe trajectories within it. A corridor-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) has been developed which controls the vehicle state to achieve a smooth and comfortable trajectory while applying trajectory constraints using the safety corridor. The safety corridor and motion controller are assessed using four typical scenarios to show that the vehicle has a human-like or human-oriented behaviour which is expected to be more acceptable for both drivers and other road users.}

The key point to make full use of ACC advantages and make up human’s weakness on supervising task is the reasonable arrangement of control time of ACC and human driver. In this paper, an MPC (Model Predictive Control) based optimized switching strategy of longitudinal driving authority transition is proposed, which aims to provide proper advice for human drivers to handover and takeover control authority, through minimizing the overall index consisted of the operation workload, fuel consumption, takeover risk and tracking errors. In addition, a new driver longitudinal model considering actual reaction time delay and insensitive distance perception of human drivers is proposed as well, which combines with ACC to constitute a typical switched control system called the switched driving model as the predictive model for MPC. The stable condition of the new driver longitudinal model is derived by using describing function method and a sufficient condition to ensure steady switched system is given by using the Lyapunov method and LMI approach. The results of simulator experiments show that the new driver model describes the car-following behavior of real human driver better. What’s more, the simulation results demonstrate that the performance index of switched driving is smaller than the human driving and ACC driving only, and the optimization time is short enough to meet the requirement of engineering practice.}

abstract = {Wider deployment of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) can help with increasing energy security and transitioning to clean vehicles. Ideally, adopters of AFVs are able to maintain the same level of mobility as users of conventional vehicles while reducing energy use and emissions. Greater knowledge of AFV benefits can support consumers’ vehicle purchase and use choices. The Environmental Protection Agency’s fuel economy ratings are a key source of potential benefits of using AFVs. However, the ratings are based on pre-designed and fixed driving cycles applied in laboratory conditions, neglecting the attributes of drivers and vehicle types. While the EPA ratings using pre-designed and fixed driving cycles may be unbiased they are not necessarily precise, owning to large variations in real-life driving. Thus, to better predict fuel economy for individual consumers targeting specific types of vehicles, it is important to find driving cycles that can better represent consumers’ real-world driving practices instead of using pre-designed standard driving cycles. This paper presents a methodology for customizing driving cycles to provide convincing fuel economy predictions that are based on drivers’ characteristics and contemporary real-world driving, along with validation efforts. The methodology takes into account current micro-driving practices in terms of maintaining speed, acceleration, braking, idling, etc., on trips. Specifically, using a large-scale driving data collected by in-vehicle Global Positioning System as part of a travel survey, a micro-trips (building block) library for California drivers is created using 54million seconds of vehicle trajectories on more than 60,000 trips, made by 3000 drivers. To generate customized driving cycles, a new tool, known as Case Based System for Driving Cycle Design, is developed. These customized cycles can predict fuel economy more precisely for conventional vehicles vis-à-vis AFVs. This is based on a consumer’s similarity in terms of their own and geographical characteristics, with a sample of micro-trips from the case library. The AFV driving cycles, created from real-world driving data, show significant differences from conventional driving cycles currently in use. This further highlights the need to enhance current fuel economy estimations by using customized driving cycles, helping consumers make more informed vehicle purchase and use decisions.}

abstract = {It has been well known that properly coordinating travelers’ route choices will help mitigate urban traffic congestion. Accordingly, coordinated routing mechanisms (CRMs), functioned as coordinated network congestion management schemes, have been developed in recent years. They often employ game theory models to strategically coordinate the route decisions of a group of travelers en route with the aim to reduce network traffic congestion. However, existing studies do not provide the solution about how to form the traveler groups, such as who and how many travelers the CRMs should involve. This issue may jeopardize the efficiency and scalability of the CRMs in practical applications. To make up this gap, this study seeks to develop the clustering aided network modeling approaches to form the coordination groups (CGs), which have the proper members and sizes for supporting the merits of the congestion management schemes. Specifically, we define coordination potential as an index to indicate the potential benefit for coordinating travelers’ route decisions on network congestion reduction. Then we develop rigorous approaches to understand the mathematical features and further quantify the coordination potential between two travelers, and among multiple travelers. Built upon that, we form the CGs through a well-designed adaptive centroid-based clustering algorithm (ACCA). It secures a local optimal clustering solution, balancing the intra-cluster and inter-cluster CP, so that we can ensure a small system performance loss as we implement a CRM on each CG. The efficiency of the CG formation approach is evaluated by the CG-CRM scheme, which partitions the travelers into multiple CGs and independently coordinates the travelers’ route choices in each CG by a CRM. The numerical experiments built upon both Sioux Falls and Hardee city networks confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the CG formation approach. Mainly, the CG-CRM outperforms the independent best response routing mechanism in system performance. As compared to the CRM working on a single group involving all travelers, the CG-CRM requires significantly less computation load with a minor compromise on the system performance. This merit becomes more apparent under high penetration and congested traffic condition. Therefore, we claim that the CG formation approach will significantly help the implementation of the coordinated congestion mitigation schemes in practice.}

abstract = {Commuting vehicles are one of the most important vehicles on the road network, especially during morning and evening peak hours. Analysis of commuting vehicles can lay foundation for policy formulation, urban planning, business decision-making. A large number of license plate recognition (LPR) detectors installed on the road network have accumulated a large amount of LPR data that contain the spatio-temporal information on vehicles. Therefore, using the LPR data, the commuting behavior of vehicles can be mined and analyzed. This study takes the LPR data of Hangzhou, China as an example, a series of algorithms are used to extract a total of nine features reflecting the commuting travel behavior using the one-month LPR data, and then the factor analysis method is used to integrate the nine extracted features into three factors. The commuting behavior is characterized from three perspectives: the stability of the vehicle travel behavior during the high frequency travel time period on working days, the stability of the vehicle travel behavior during the non high frequency travel time period, the stability of the origin and destination (OD) of a vehicle during the high frequency travel time period. Based on these three factors, three methods, including the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm (DBSCAN), the iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm (ISODATA), and the fast search and find of density peaks clustering algorithm, are used to identify commuting pattern vehicles and their results are compared. Finally, the decision tree algorithm is used to extract the commuting rule and identify commuting vehicles from the collected data. After that, The influence of different high frequency travel time period on commuting rule extraction and commuting pattern vehicle recognition is carefully analyzed. The influence of randomness on the results is also tested. The proposed commuting pattern vehicle recognition algorithm is proved to be robust. The detection frequency and the first and last detected times of commuting vehicles and non commuting vehicles are then analyzed. 78.0% of commuting vehicles were first detected between 06:30 AM and 10:30 AM on each workday on average. And 77.8% of commuting vehicles were last detected between 03:30 PM and 09:30 PM on each workday on average. However, for non commuting vehicles, the phenomenon that start or end the travel during the high frequency travel time period is not obvious. This study lays a foundation for travel policy formulation. For instance, it can provide a reference for the determination of the restricted periods when implementing the travel restriction policy. In addition, the identification of commuting vehicles is extremely useful for public transit network design and optimization, and it can help the decision-making process of a customized commuter bus. In addition, these strategies are expected to reduce the use of private cars and encourage travelers to switch to public transportation.}

The overall framework emphasizes the design goals of: generality, code agility, and high performance. This framework allows the modeling of several aspects of transportation system that are typically done with separate stand-alone software applications, in a high-performance and extensible manner. The issue of integrating such models as dynamic traffic assignment and disaggregate demand models has been a long standing issue for transportation modelers. The integrated approach shows a possible way to resolve this difficulty. The simulation model built from the POLARIS framework is a single, shared-memory process for handling all aspects of the integrated urban simulation. The resulting gains in computational efficiency and performance allow planning models to be extended to include previously separate aspects of the urban system, enhancing the utility of such models from the planning perspective. Initial tests with case studies involving traffic management center impacts on various network events such as accidents show the potential of the system.}

Similar to the previously developed probabilistic approach, in this paper, we consider the population synthesis problem to be the inference of a joint probability distribution. In this sense, the Bayesian network model becomes an efficient tool that allows us to compactly represent/reproduce the structure of the population system and preserve privacy and confidentiality in the meanwhile. We demonstrate and assess the performance of this approach in generating synthetic population for Singapore, by using the Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) data as the known test population. Our results show that the introduced Bayesian network approach is powerful in characterizing the underlying joint distribution, and meanwhile the overfitting of data can be avoided as much as possible.}

Traditional studies focus on regular demand forecasting and have inherent disadvantages in predicting passenger flows under special events scenarios. These special events may have a disruptive impact on public transportation systems, and should thus be given more attention for proactive management and timely information dissemination. This study proposes a novel multiscale radial basis function (MSRBF) network for forecasting the irregular fluctuation of subway passenger flows. This model is simplified using a matching pursuit orthogonal least squares algorithm through the selection of significant model terms to produce a parsimonious MSRBF model. Combined with transit smart card data, this approach not only exhibits superior predictive performance over prevailing computational intelligence methods for non-regular demand forecasting at least 30min prior, but also leverages network knowledge to enhance prediction capability and pinpoint vulnerable subway stations for crowd control measures. Three empirical studies with special events in Beijing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively predict the emergence of passenger flow bursts.}

abstract = {Autonomous driving technologies are advancing rapidly, and determining when consumers ride in driverless vehicles on a daily basis is becoming essential. Using choice experiments, first, we elicit consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for autonomous driving systems in Japan along with their WTP for hybrid and electric engines. We found in this study that the Japanese consumers’ WTP is, on average, lower than the estimates for the US market and is not sufficient to enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to capture a meaningful share of the existing car market. Second, compared with a previous study in the US, we propose and discuss an expected social dilemma caused by the ethical problems that AVs will face, known as the Trolley Problems. We find that social dilemma may occur because people tend not want to buy “moral” AVs. Third, we explored the determinants of the WTP and social dilemma to find that the credibility of AVs is determined to be a critical factor for the social dilemma.}

The pattern of the incident could be quite similar to non-incident cases as intersections get congested. This paper describes the development of a fuzzy logic for incident detection. An Integrated System for Incident Management (-sim) was developed. An integral component of such system is a microscopic simulator, -sim-s, an object-oriented model that allows for virtual detector installations at different locations, modeling different intersection layouts, traffic control types and timing, and link characteristics. -sim-s was utilized to generate various incident scenarios and extracting associated detectors’ accumulative counts. A data clustering technique was utilized to consolidate the various incident scenarios into a single data set for the development of the Fuzzy Logic for incident detection at intersections (-sim-fl). The -sim-fl uses the detector data as well as other link properties in flagging detecting incidents. The -sim-fl can be used to indicate the possibility of an incident, a stalled vehicle, or a sort of traffic disturbance. The devised logic was validated using separate simulation-based incident scenarios.}

Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) data is now being used to allow vehicles to cooperate better with current and future environments, such as traffic conditions, signal timing, and terrain information. This study proposes an eco-drive algorithm for vehicle fuel consumption optimization on rolling terrains, which frequently causes additional fuel waste due to the inefficient transformation between kinetic and potential energy. The algorithm using the Relaxed Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (RPMP) is computationally efficient and applicable in real time. While similar algorithms have proven effective in simulations with many assumptions, it is necessary to test these algorithms in the field to better understand the algorithm performance and thus make enhancements to optimally control vehicles for eco-drive. Therefore, this study further tested and verified the newly developed algorithms on an innovative CAV platform and quantified the fuel saving benefits of eco-drive. The proposed eco-drive system is compared against conventional constant speed cruise control on a total of 7 road segments over 47 miles. Experimental data shows that more than 20 percent of fuel consumption can be saved. Detailed analysis through linear models also reveal the main geometrical contributors to the eco-drive fuel savings. This finding can provide a rough estimate of the fuel saving potential of given roadways and help state departments of transportation to identify roadways where eco-drive should be implemented. The algorithm and the experiment can also support original equipment manufacturers in developing and marketing this technology to reduce fuel consumption and emissions in the future.}

A specialized algorithm based on sensitivity analysis and the alternative direction method of multiplier (ADMM) is developed to find a local optimum for the MPEC. Results of numerical experiments show that (1) in all tested cases, controlling a minority of vehicles (less than 10% in some case) could bring the system very close to the system optimum; (2) some O-D pairs enjoy a higher control priority than the others, mostly due to the underlying network topology rather than the demand magnitude; (3) the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient; (4) starting from different initial solutions, the algorithm produces very similar local optimal solutions.}

Based on images of rails, the proposed framework is capable to detect the location of cracks firstly and next automatically obtain the boundary of cracks via a feature-based linear iterative crack aggregation (FLICA). Extended Haar-like features are applied to develop significant features for identifying cracks in images. Built on extended Haar-like features, a cascading classifier ensemble integrating three single cascading classifiers with a major voting scheme is proposed to decide the presence of cracks in the image. Each single cascading classifier is composed of a sequence of stage classifiers trained by the LogitBoost algorithm. A scalable sliding window carrying the cascading classifier ensemble is applied to scan images of rail tracks, which is identified by the Otsu’s method, and detect cracks. After completing the crack registration in the first layer, the FLICA is developed to discover boundaries of cracks. The effectiveness of the proposed data-driven framework for identifying rail surface cracks is validated with the rail images provided by the China Railway Corporation and Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MRT). Six benchmarking methods, the Otsu’s method, mean shift, the visual detection system, the geometrical approach, fully convolutional networks and the U-net, are utilized to prove advantages of the proposed framework. Results of the validation and comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework is most effective in the rail surface crack detection.}

To further improve its already respectable safety records, the airline industry is transitioning towards a proactive approach which anticipates and mitigates risks before incidents occur. This approach requires continuous monitoring and analysis of flight operations; however, modern aircraft systems have become increasingly complex to a degree that traditional analytical methods have reached their limits – the current methods in use can only detect ‘hazardous’ behaviors on a pre-defined list; they will miss important risks that are unlisted or unknown. This paper presents a novel approach to apply data mining in flight data analysis allowing airline safety experts to identify latent risks from daily operations without specifying what to look for in advance. In this approach, we apply a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based clustering to digital flight data in order to detect flights with unusual data patterns. These flights may indicate an increased level of risks under the assumption that normal flights share common patterns, while anomalies do not. Safety experts can then review these flights in detail to identify risks, if any. Compared with other data-driven methods to monitor flight operations, this approach, referred to as ClusterAD-DataSample, can (1) better establish the norm by automatically recognizing multiple typical patterns of flight operations, and (2) pinpoint which part of a detected flight is abnormal. Evaluation of ClusterAD-DataSample was performed on two sets of A320 flight data of real-world airline operations; results showed that ClusterAD-DataSample was able to detect abnormal flights with elevated risks, which make it a promising tool for airline operators to identify early signs of safety degradation even if the criteria are unknown a priori.}

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a novel reliable path finding algorithm for a stochastic road network with uncertainty in travel times while both electric vehicle energy and efficiency are simultaneously taken into account. We first propose a bi-objective optimization model to maximize (1) the on-time arrival reliability and (2) energy-efficiency for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in a path finding problem. The former objective requires finding the reliable shortest path (RSP), which is the path with the minimal effective travel time measured by the sum of the mean travel time and a travel time safety margin for any given origin-destination (OD) pair. Then, we refer to energy-efficiency as the minimum of the electric energy consumption. We discuss the non-additive property of the RSP problem since we also consider the link travel time correlations, whereas the latter objective satisfies the additive criterion. To this end, we illustrate the existence of non-dominated solutions that satisfy both of the two objectives. Furthermore, it is shown that the intersection of two candidate sets – one for the RSPs and the other for paths with minimal energy-consumption - actually contains the optimal solution for the bi-objective optimization problem. The upper and lower bounds of the effective travel time are mathematically deduced and can be used to generate the candidate path set of this bi-objective problem via the K-shortest algorithm. Our proposed algorithm overcomes the infeasibility of traditional path finding algorithms (e.g., the Dijkstra algorithm) for RSPs. Moreover, using two numerical examples, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. We numerically demonstrate promising potential applications of the proposed algorithm in real-life road traffic networks.}

Joint leisure activities can account for up to 60% of trips in cities and unlike fixed trips (i.e., trips to work where the arrival time and the trip destination are predefined), leisure activities offer more optimization flexibility since the activity destination and the arrival times of individuals can vary. To address this problem, a perceived utility model derived from non-traditional data such as smartphones/social media for representing users’ willingness to travel a certain distance for participating in leisure activities at different times of day is presented. Then, a stochastic annealing search method for addressing the exponential complexity optimization problem is introduced. The stochastic annealing method suggests the preferred location of a joint leisure activity and the arrival times of individuals based on the users’ preferences derived from the perceived utility model. Test-case implementations of the approach used 14-month social media data from London and showcased an increase of up to 3 times at individuals’ satisfaction while the computational complexity is reduced to almost linear time serving the real-time implementation requirements.}

Progress in mobile communication technology with higher bandwidths and lower latencies enables the use of data provided by in-car sensors.

Data mining methods, adapted to data streams, can be used to analyze the data and to identify interesting patterns such as congestion or road hazards. Although several data stream mining methods have been proposed, an evaluation of such methods in the context of traffic applications is yet missing. In this paper, we present an evaluation framework for traffic information systems based on data streams. We apply a traffic simulation software to emulate the generation of traffic data by mobile probes. The framework is applied in two case studies, namely queue-end detection and traffic state estimation. The results show which parameters of the traffic information system significantly impact the accuracy of the predicted traffic information. This provides important findings for the design and implementation of traffic information systems using data from mobile probes.}

Although advances have been made in understanding both the promotion of ADS trust and its impact on NDRT performance, the influence of risk remains largely understudied. To fill this gap, we conducted a within-subjects experiment with 37 licensed drivers using a simulator. Internal risk was manipulated by ADS reliability and external risk by visibility, producing a 2 (ADS reliability) × 2 (visibility) design. The results indicate that high reliability increases ADS trust and further enhances the positive impact of ADS trust on NDRT performance, while low visibility reduces the negative impact of ADS trust on driver monitoring. Results also suggest that trust increases over time if the system is reliable and that visibility did not have a significant impact on ADS trust. These findings are important for the design of intelligent ADSs that can respond to drivers’ trusting behaviors.}

After briefly discussing the current state of driverless vehicle technology, we suggest that systems that rely upon human supervision are likely to be dangerous when used by ordinary people in real-world driving conditions and are unlikely to satisfy the desires of consumers. We then argue that the invention of fully autonomous vehicles that pose a lower risk to third parties than human drivers will establish a compelling case against the moral permissibility of manual driving. As long as driverless vehicles aren’t safer than human drivers, it will be unethical to sell them. Once they are safer than human drivers when it comes to risks to 3rd parties, then it should be illegal to drive them: at that point human drivers will be the moral equivalent of drunk robots. We also describe two plausible mechanisms whereby this ethical argument may generate political pressure to have it reflected in legislation. Freeing people from the necessity of driving, though, will transform the relationship people have with their cars, which will in turn open up new possibilities for the transport uses of the automobile. The ethical challenge posed by driverless vehicles for transport policy is therefore to ensure that the most socially and environmentally beneficial of these possibilities is realised. We highlight several key policy choices that will determine how likely it is that this challenge will be met.}

In this paper, we propose an efficient vehicle detection method by designing vehicle detection grammars and handling partial occlusion. The grammar model is implemented by novel detection grammars, including structure, deformation and pairwise SVM grammars. First, the vehicle is divided into its constitute parts, called semantic parts, which can represent the vehicle effectively. To increase the robustness of part detection, the semantic parts are represented by their detection score maps. The semantic parts are further divided into sub-parts automatically. The two-layer division of the vehicle is modeled into a grammar model. Then, the grammar model is trained by a designed training procedure to get ideal grammar parameters, including appearance models and grammar productions. After that, vehicle detection is executed by a designed detection procedure with respect to the grammar model. Finally, the issue of vehicle occlusion is handled by designing and training specific grammars. The strategy adopted by our method is first to divide the vehicle into the semantic parts and sub-parts, then to train the grammar productions for semantic parts and sub-parts by introducing novel pairwise SVM grammars and finally to detect the vehicle by applying the trained grammars. Experiments in practical urban scenarios are carried out for complex traffic surveillance. It can be shown that our method adapts to partial occlusion and various challenging cases.}

Whereas existing methods focus on predicting the next location of users, little is known regarding the prediction of the next trip. The paper develops a methodology for predicting daily individual mobility represented as a chain of trips (including the null set, no travel), each defined as a combination of the trip start time t, origin o, and destination d. To predict individual mobility, we first predict whether the user will travel (trip making prediction), and then, if so, predict the attributes of the next trip (t,o,d) (trip attribute prediction). Each of the two problems can be further decomposed into two subproblems based on the triggering event. For trip attribute prediction, we propose a new model, based on the Bayesian n-gram model used in language modeling, to estimate the probability distribution of the next trip conditional on the previous one. The proposed methodology is tested using the pseudonymized transit smart card records from more than 10,000 users in London, U.K. over two years. Based on regularized logistic regression, our trip making prediction models achieve median accuracy levels of over 80%. The prediction accuracy for trip attributes varies by the attribute considered—around 40% for t, 70–80% for o and 60–70% for d. Relatively, the first trip of the day is more difficult to predict. Significant variations are found across individuals in terms of the model performance, implying diverse travel behavior patterns.}

We evaluated the performance of each holding method in terms of headway instability and mean holding time. We tested the sensitivity of holding methods to their parameterization and to the number of control points. We found that Schedule-Based methods require little holding time but are unable to stabilize headways even when applied at a high control point density. The Headway-Based methods are able to successfully control headways but they require long holding times. Prediction-Based methods achieve the best compromise between headway regularity and holding time on a wide range of desired trade-offs. Finally, we found the prediction-based methods to be sensitive to prediction accuracy, but using an existing prediction method we were able to minimize this sensitivity. These results can be used to inform the decision of transit agencies to implement holding methods on routes similar to TriMet 72.}

This is a complex control problem rarely explored in the literature. In particular, modeling the interaction between the network level control and the local level control has not been fully considered. Utilizing the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) as the traffic performance indicator, we formulate a dynamic system model, and design a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based controller coupling two competing control objectives and optimizing the performance at the local and the network level as a whole. To solve this highly non-linear optimization problem, we employ an approximation framework, enabling the optimal solution of this large-scale problem to be feasible and efficient. Numerical analysis shows that by applying the proposed controller, the protected network can operate around the desired state as expressed by the MFD, while the total delay at the perimeter is minimized as well. Moreover, the paper sheds light on the robustness of the proposed controller. This multi-scale hybrid controller is further extended to a stochastic MPC scheme, where connected vehicles (CV) serve as the only data source. Hence, low penetration rates of CVs lead to strong noises in the controller. This is a first attempt to develop a network-level traffic control methodology by using the emerging CV technology. We consider the stochasticity in traffic state estimation and the shape of the MFD. Simulation analysis demonstrates the robustness of the proposed stochastic controller, showing that efficient controllers can indeed be designed with this newly-spread vehicle technology even in the absence of other data collection schemes (e.g. loop detectors).}

abstract = {Understanding people flow at a citywide level is critical for urban planning and commercial development. Thanks to the ubiquity of human location tracking devices, many studies on people mass movement with mobility logs have been conducted. However, high cost and severe privacy policy constraints still complicate utilization of these data in practice. There is no dataset that anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel dataset creation approach (called Open PFLOW) that continuously reports the spatiotemporal positions of all individual’s in urban areas based on open data. With fully consideration of the privacy protection, each entity in our dataset does not match the actual movement of any real person, so that the dataset can be totally open to public as part of data infrastructure. Because the result is shown at a disaggregate level, users can freely modify, process, and visualize the dataset for any purpose. We evaluate the accuracy of the dataset by comparing it with commercial datasets and traffic census indicates that it has a high correlation with mesh population and link-based traffic volume.}

The three major components that are estimated in the present context are MFD shapes, regional trip lengths and path flow distribution. A trip enrichment scheme based on the map matching process is proposed for the trips that have sparser records. Time dependent penetration rates are estimated by fusing the OD matrix and the Loop Detector Data (LDD). Two different types of penetration rates of vehicles are proposed based on the OD flow and the trips starting within an origin, respectively. The estimated MFDs based on two types of penetration rates are stable with very low scatter. In the following step, macro-paths and their corresponding trip lengths are estimated. This work is the first to present empirical evidences of the dynamic evolution of mean trip lengths over the day, which is very difficult to capture with other types of data sources. The last component is the time dependent path flow distributions between the different macro-paths for a given OD pair. The manuscript is concluded by presenting the time evolution of the User Equilibrium (UE) gap for different macroscopic OD pairs. It is noticed that UE principle holds true most of the time, except for OD pairs that have macro-paths transversing through congested reservoirs, especially during peak hours.}

In recent years, railways have also become a data-rich environment. Railway infrastructure assets have a very long life, but inherently degrade. Interventions are necessary but they can cause lateness, damage and hazards. Every day, thousands of discrete maintenance jobs are scheduled according to time and urgency. Service disruption has a direct economic impact. Planning for maintenance can be complex, expensive and uncertain. Autonomous scheduling of maintenance jobs is essential. The design strategy of a novel integrated system for automatic job scheduling is presented; from concept formulation to the examination of the data to information transitional level interface, and at the decision making level. The underlying architecture configures high-level fusion of technical and business drivers; scheduling optimized intervention plans that factor-in cost impact and added value. A proof of concept demonstrator was developed to validate the system principle and to test algorithm functionality. It employs a dashboard for visualization of the system response and to present key information. Real track incident and inspection datasets were analyzed to raise degradation alarms that initiate the automatic scheduling of maintenance tasks. Optimum scheduling was realized through data analytics and job sequencing heuristic and genetic algorithms, taking into account specific cost & value inputs from comprehensive task cost modelling. Formal face validation was conducted with railway infrastructure specialists and stakeholders. The demonstrator structure was found fit for purpose with logical component relationships, offering further scope for research and commercial exploitation.}

However, finding the globally optimal solution of the repair and work zone policy for a large-scale pavement network along a long-term planning horizon can be computationally cumbersome. In this study, as a benchmark, we first propose an exact solution algorithm based on dynamic programming. Then we second propose a computationally feasible methodology, a time-invariant simplified rule, to determine desirable (near-optimal) policies. The proposed methodology is applied to two numerical studies: (i) Case 1 for a small-scale road pavement system to compare life cycle costs and computational times between the rule-based methodology and the exact solution algorithm, and (ii) Case 2 for a real-scale road pavement system to discuss the effectiveness of the rule-based methodology. In Case 1, the rule-based methodology derives a near-optimal solution with a significantly shorter computational time than the exact solution algorithm. Case 2 shows that the rule-based methodology can find a superior policy to the aggregation of the optimal solutions independently found for each of decomposed sub-systems in a feasible computational time. Through sensitivity analyses, we find that the repair and work zone policies should vary depending on the deterioration process, cost factors, and weight between agency and user costs for society’s view or available budget for the agency’s perspective.}

However, the early promises of ridesharing for alleviating congestion in cities may be undermined by a number of challenges, including the growing number of proposed services and the subsequent increasing number of vehicles, as a natural consequence of competition. In this work, we present optimization-based approaches to model cooperation and competition between multiple ridesharing companies, in a real-time on-demand setting. A recent trend relies on solving the integrated combination of Dial-A-Ride Problems (DARP), which compute the cost of assigning incoming requests to vehicle routes, plus Linear Assignment Problems (LAP), which assign vehicles to requests. While the DARPs, are solved at the level of the vehicles of each company, we introduce cooperative and competitive approaches to solve the LAP. The cooperative model, which could make use of Mobility as a Service platforms, is shown to solve the LAP to optimality following closely results from the literature, and limiting the amount of information the companies are required to share. We investigate how a realistic model of competition deviates from this optimality and provide worst case bounds. We evaluate these models with respect to a centralized model on one-week instances of the New York City taxi dataset. Model variants coping with noise in the travel time estimations, bias in the assignment costs, and preferences in the competitive case are also presented and validated. The computational results suggest that cooperation among ridesharing companies can be conducted in such a way to limit the degradation of the level of service with respect to a centralized model. Finally, we argue that the competition can lower the quality of the ridesharing service, especially in the case customer preferences are accommodated.}

Commuting, different types of transfer, and other travel behaviors have been identified. Besides, varying travel-activity chains like “Home→Work→Post-work activity (for dining or shopping)→Back home” and the corresponding travel motifs have been distinguished by incorporating the land use information in the GIS data. The analysis results contribute to our understanding of transit riders’ travel behavior. We also present application examples of the travel motif to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach. Our methodology can be adapted to travel pattern analysis using different data sources and lay the foundation for other travel-pattern related studies.}

Calibration and validation techniques pave the way towards the descriptive power of car-following models and their applicability for analyzing traffic flow. However, calibrating these models is never a trivial task. This is caused by the fact that some parameters, such as reaction time, are generally not directly observable from traffic data. On the other hand, traffic data might be subject to various errors and noises. This contribution puts forward a Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) based approach to identify parameters of deterministic car-following models under noisy data by formulating it as a stochastic optimization problem. This approach allows for statistical analysis of the parameter estimations. Another challenge arising in the calibration of car following models concerns the selection of the most important parameters. This paper introduces a relative entropy based Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) algorithm to identify the important parameters so as to reduce the complexity, data requirement and computational effort of the calibration process. Since the CEM and the PSA are based on the Kullback–Leibler (K–L) distance, they can be simultaneously integrated into a unified framework to further reduce the computational burden. The proposed framework is applied to calibrate the intelligent driving model using vehicle trajectories data from the NGSIM project. Results confirm the great potential of this approach.}

With this data-driven approach, our proposed approach is versatile: it is compatible with other data sources, and it is model agnostic and thus compatible with user equilibrium, system-optimum, Stackelberg concepts, and other models. Using a dimensionality reduction scheme, we design a projected gradient algorithm suitable for the proposed route flow estimation problem. The algorithm solves a block isotonic regression problem in the projection step in linear time. The accuracy, computational efficiency, and versatility of the proposed approach are validated on the I-210 corridor near Los Angeles, where we achieve 90% route flow accuracy with 1033 traffic sensors and 1000 cellular towers covering a large network of highways and arterials with more than 20,000 links. In contrast to long-term land use planning applications, we demonstrate the first system to our knowledge that can produce route-level flow estimates suitable for short time horizon prediction and control applications in traffic management. Our system is open source and available for validation and extension.}

The main premise is that the heterogeneity in preferred acceleration rate, desired speed, and car-following (CF) behavior (e.g., reaction pattern and sensitivity to a traffic disturbance) will change traffic properties in ways that can undermine traffic flow throughput. This paper first decomposes the mechanism into two elements – one driven by acceleration and one by time-varying CF response to disturbances – and then investigates their compounded effect. This paper also provides unifying frameworks to analyze the behavior of RVs and CAVs to facilitate analytical investigations. The results reveal how heterogeneous acceleration and CF behavior may create persistent voids and diminish traffic throughput. Integrating all the elements, throughput reduction is quantified via numerical simulations.}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach which involves user-based vehicle relocations to address supply-and-demand mismatches; in our approach, VSS users are offered price incentives so as to accept picking up their vehicle from an oversupplied station and/or to drop it off to an under-supplied station. The system incentivizes users based on the priorities of vehicle relocations among stations, taking into account the fluctuating demand for vehicles and parking places at different stations over time. A graph-theoretic approach is employed for modeling the problem of allocating vehicles to users in a way that maximizes the profit of the system taking into account the budget the VSS can afford to spend for rewarding users, as well as the users’ strategic behavior. We present two different schemes for incentivizing users to act in favour of the system. Both schemes consider budget constraints and are truthful and budget-feasible. We have extensively evaluated our approach through simulations which demonstrated significant gain with respect to the number of completed trips and system revenue. We have also validated our approach through pilot trials conducted in a free-floating e-motorbike sharing system in the framework of an EU-funded research project.}

In this environment, a disparate mix of road users shares the same road. In order to address road-safety and level of service requirements for the different types of road-users, traffic information needs to be collected with high degree accuracy. The reliability and accuracy of the data collected can significantly affect the quality of analysis. In recent years, automated video analysis was established as a robust tool for data collection. Road-user trajectories obtained through automated computer vision are rich in information. They hold features that reveal the structure of the traffic scene and provide clues to the movement characteristics of the road-users. The objective of this paper is to present and evaluate a road-user classification procedure. The classification relies on the motion pattern attributes associated with the trajectories of each road-user type, namely, vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. A novel approach for features selection is proposed where singular spectrum analysis (SSA) identifies the basic harmonics (speed variation patterns) characterizing the movement behaviors. Constrained based classification and spectral clustering are then applied on the selected features to categorize the road-users. Several case studies are used for the evaluation of the proposed classification. The case studies use real world data sets collected at a roundabout and a conventional four-legged intersection in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia. Very promising results were demonstrated and evaluated through several performance measures. The main benefit of this research is to apply classification as a first step in the activity and behavior recognition of road-users in traffic scenes. The proposed approach is useful as a complement to vision based classification, where road-users classes can be difficult due to partial occlusion or when the extraction of physical characteristics (descriptive features) of road-users does not provide enough details to reveal the correct type of a road-user.}

The relocation process is activated at constant gap times in order to carry out dynamic bike redistribution, mainly aimed at achieving a high degree of user satisfaction and keeping the vehicle repositioning costs as low as possible. An application to a test case study, together with a detailed sensitivity analysis, shows the effectiveness of the suggested novel methodology for the real-time management of the free-floating bike-sharing systems.}

abstract = {Fully automated vehicles could have a significant share of the road network traffic in the near future. Several commercial vehicles with full-range Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems or semi-autonomous functionalities are already available on the market. Many research studies aim at leveraging the potential of automated driving in order to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles. However, in the vast majority of those, fuel efficiency is isolated to the driving dynamics between a single follower-leader pair, hence overlooking the complex nature of traffic. Consequently fuel efficiency and the efficient use of the roadway capacity are framed as conflicting objectives, leading to fuel-economy control models that adopt highly conservative driving styles. This formulation of the problem could be seen as a user-optimal approach, where in spite of delivering savings for individual vehicles, there is the side-effect of the deterioration of traffic flow. An important point that is overlooked is that the inefficient use of roadway capacity gives rise to congested traffic and traffic breakdowns, which in return increases energy costs within the system. The optimisation methods used in these studies entail high computational costs and, therefore, impose a strict constraint on the scope of problem. In this study, the use of car-following models and the limitation of the search space of optimal strategies to the parameter space of these is proposed. The proposed framework enables performing much more comprehensive optimisations and conducting more extensive tests on the collective impacts of fuel-economy driving strategies. The results show that, as conjectured, a “short-sighted” user-optimal approach is unable to deliver overall fuel efficiency. Conversely, a system-optimal formulation for fuel efficient driving is presented, and it is shown that the objectives of fuel efficiency and traffic flow are in fact not only non-conflicting, but also that they could be viewed as one when the global benefits to the network are considered.}

Nowadays, with the widespread deployment of GPS-enabled devices, it has become possible to crowdsource the collection of speed information to road users (e.g. through mobile applications or dedicated in-vehicle devices). Despite its rather wide spatial coverage, crowdsourced speed data also brings very important challenges, such as the highly variable measurement noise in the data due to a variety of driving behaviors and sample sizes. When not properly accounted for, this noise can severely compromise any application that relies on accurate traffic data. In this article, we propose the use of heteroscedastic Gaussian processes (HGP) to model the time-varying uncertainty in large-scale crowdsourced traffic data. Furthermore, we develop a HGP conditioned on sample size and traffic regime (SSRC-HGP), which makes use of sample size information (probe vehicles per minute) as well as previous observed speeds, in order to more accurately model the uncertainty in observed speeds. Using 6 months of crowdsourced traffic data from Copenhagen, we empirically show that the proposed heteroscedastic models produce significantly better predictive distributions when compared to current state-of-the-art methods for both speed imputation and short-term forecasting tasks.}

abstract = {Even though a variety of human mobility models have been recently developed, models that can capture real-time human mobility of urban populations in a sustainable and economical manner are still lacking. Here, we propose a novel human mobility model that combines the advantages of mobile phone signaling data (i.e., comprehensive penetration in a population) and urban transportation data (i.e., continuous collection and high accuracy). Using the proposed human mobility model, travel demands during each 1-h time window were estimated for the city of Shenzhen, China. Significantly, the estimated travel demands not only preserved the distribution of travel demands, but also captured real-time bursts of mobility fluxes during large crowding events. Finally, based on the proposed human mobility model, a predictive model is deployed to predict crowd gatherings that usually cause severe traffic jams.}

abstract = {Nowadays, problems of congestion in urban areas due to the massive usage of cars, last-minute travel needs and progress in information and communication technologies have fostered the rise of new transportation modes such as ridesharing. In a ridesharing service, a car owner shares empty seats of his car with other travelers. Recent ridesharing approaches help to identify interesting meeting points to improve the efficiency of the ridesharing service (i.e., the best pick-up and drop-off points so that the travel cost is competitive for both driver and rider). In particular, ridesharing services, such as Blablacar or Carma, have become a good mobility alternative for users in their daily life. However, this success has come at the cost of user privacy. Indeed in current’s ridesharing services, users are not in control of their own data and have to trust the ridesharing operators with the management of their data. In this paper, we aim at developing a privacy-preserving service to compute meeting points in ridesharing, such that each user remains in control of his location data. More precisely, we propose a decentralized architecture that provides strong security and privacy guarantees without sacrificing the usability of ridesharing services. In particular, our approach protects the privacy of location data of users. Following the privacy-by-design principle, we have integrated existing privacy enhancing technologies and multimodal shortest path algorithms to privately compute mutually interesting meeting points for both drivers and riders in ridesharing. In addition, we have built a prototype implementation of the proposed approach. The experiments, conducted on a real transportation network, have demonstrated that it is possible to reach a trade-off in which both the privacy and utility levels are satisfactory.}

abstract = {The current state-of-practice for predicting travel times assumes that the speeds along the various roadway segments remain constant over the duration of the trip. This approach produces large prediction errors, especially when the segment speeds vary temporally. In this paper, we develop a data clustering and genetic programming approach for modeling and predicting the expected, lower, and upper bounds of dynamic travel times along freeways. The models obtained from the genetic programming approach are algebraic expressions that provide insights into the spatiotemporal interactions. The use of an algebraic equation also means that the approach is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. Our algorithm is tested on a 37-mile freeway section encompassing several bottlenecks. The prediction error is demonstrated to be significantly lower than that produced by the instantaneous algorithm and the historical average averaged over seven weekdays (p-value <0.0001). Specifically, the proposed algorithm achieves more than a 25% and 76% reduction in the prediction error over the instantaneous and historical average, respectively on congested days. When bagging is used in addition to the genetic programming, the results show that the mean width of the travel time interval is less than 5min for the 60–80min trip.}

We propose to mine tweet texts to extract incident information on both highways and arterials as an efficient and cost-effective alternative to existing data sources. This paper presents a methodology to crawl, process and filter tweets that are accessible by the public for free. Tweets are acquired from Twitter using the REST API in real time. The process of adaptive data acquisition establishes a dictionary of important keywords and their combinations that can imply traffic incidents (TI). A tweet is then mapped into a high dimensional binary vector in a feature space formed by the dictionary, and classified into either TI related or not. All the TI tweets are then geocoded to determine their locations, and further classified into one of the five incident categories. We apply the methodology in two regions, the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia Metropolitan Areas. Overall, mining tweets holds great potentials to complement existing traffic incident data in a very cheap way. A small sample of tweets acquired from the Twitter API cover most of the incidents reported in the existing data set, and additional incidents can be identified through analyzing tweets text. Twitter also provides ample additional information with a reasonable coverage on arterials. A tweet that is related to TI and geocodable accounts for approximately 5% of all the acquired tweets. Of those geocodable TI tweets, 60–70% are posted by influential users (IU), namely public Twitter accounts mostly owned by public agencies and media, while the rest is contributed by individual users. There is more incident information provided by Twitter on weekends than on weekdays. Within the same day, both individuals and IUs tend to report incidents more frequently during the day time than at night, especially during traffic peak hours. Individual tweets are more likely to report incidents near the center of a city, and the volume of information significantly decays outwards from the center.}

The realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply “drones” have been proposed as a pioneering tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics, but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion. A swarm of 10 drones hovering over the central business district of Athens over multiple days to record traffic streams in a congested area of a 1.3 km2 area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100 busy intersections (signalized or not), many bus stops and close to half a million trajectories. The aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena. The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors. This open science initiative creates a unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude higher than what was available till now, that researchers from different disciplines around the globe can use to develop and test their own models.}

Regulatory authorities such as the Federal Aviation Agency constantly introduce new fatigue regulations, often in the form of hard constraints on the length of duty and rest periods. The complex nature of travel-related fatigue, however, makes it difficult to account for it indirectly through such constraints. Recent studies show that fatigue depends on human factors such as the homeostatic process and the circadian body clock as well as time-zone differences. In this work, we explicitly account for fatigue in crew pairing optimization through the Three Process Model of Alertness, one of the most comprehensive fatigue models available in the literature. We provide a mathematical model for the crew pairing problem that incorporates fatigue and solve it using a column generation approach. Numerical analysis on two real data sets reveals that the proposed approach is able to reduce the crew fatigue levels substantially with minimal impact on cost. In particular, it is shown that hard constraints on fatigue may still lead to high fatigue levels and that jet-lag and time-zone differences have a major impact. The results of the tests also show that some of the rules and regulations in practice may be omitted if the fatigue is accounted for directly.}

abstract = {The use of smartphone applications (apps) to acquire real time and readily available journey planning information is becoming instinctive behavior by public transport (PT) users. Through the apps, a passenger not only seeks a path from origin to destination, but a satisfactory path that caters to the passenger’s preferences at the desired time of travel. Essentially, apps attempt to provide a means of personalized PT service. As the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic take form and infiltrate human and environmental interactions, passenger preference personalization will likely include avoiding risks of infection or contagious contact. The personal preferences are enabled by multiple attributes associated with alternative PT routes. For instance, preferences can be connected to attributes of time, cost, and convenience. This work establishes a personalized PT service, as an adjustment to current design frameworks, by integrating user app experience with operators’ data sources and operations modeling. The work proceeds to focus on its key component: the personalized route guidance methodology. In addition to using the existing shortest path or k-weighted shortest path method, this study develops a novel, lexicographical shortest path method, considering a just noticeable difference (JND). The method adopts lexicographical ordering to capture passenger preferences for different PT attributes following Ernst Weber’s law of human perception threshold. However, a direct application of Weber’s law violates the axiom of transitivity required for an implementable algorithm, and thus, a revised method is developed with proven algorithms for ranking different paths. The differences between the three route-guidance methods and the effects of the JND perception threshold on the order of the alternative PT routes are demonstrated with an example. The developments were examined in a case study by simulation on the Copenhagen PT network. The results show that using the JND method reduces the value/cost of the most important attributes. Identical robust results are attained when JND parameters are not specified and default values are used. The latter may apply for the future with a mixture of specified and default preference input values. Finally, the computation time indicates a favorable potential for real-life applications. It is believed that the consideration of human threshold perception will encourage decision makers to establish new criteria to comply with this.}

During the last decade a considerable amount of research studies have been proposed, filling the gap between prototypes and commercial implementations. Pedestrian detection systems can be roughly divided into three main different sub-parts: Region Of Interest – ROI – selection, classification and tracking. Previous surveys have covered the literature in a holistic way. An example would be, analyzing all the solutions proposed for all the stages and including higher level analysis, but in most cases they give more emphasis to the classification stage. Due to the difficulty of this detection task, the variety of solutions, sensor configurations (monocular/stereo; visible/infrared) available in the literature, we propose to break down the variability of the problem by providing exhaustive review of one specific stage: stereo-based ROI selection. ROI selection is a key component that has to be designed to provide generic obstacles at lowest false negative rate and maintain a low number of false positives. The number of missed pedestrians has to be approximately equal to 0 since a pedestrian missed by the ROI selection stage would not be detected in further stages. In addition, the number of non-pedestrians obstacles should be as low as possible to reduce both the number of false alarms and the computational costs of further stages. In contrast to monocular approaches, stereo ROI selection determines the relative distance between the pedestrian and the vehicle, assuring that the reported candidates are related with real physical objects. The stereo-based ROI selection step is also divided into different components that are independently analyzed, increasing visibility for future proposals and developments. Discussion is finally presented highlighting the current problems for obtaining a global overview of the actual performance of the different approaches and analyzing future trends.}

The system adopts a closed-loop rolling horizon framework in which network state estimation and prediction modules are integrated with a traffic network manager module to generate efficient proactive traffic management schemes. The traffic network manger adopts a meta-heuristic search mechanism to construct the schemes by integrating a wide variety of control strategies. The system is applied in the context of Integrated Corridor Management (ICM), which is envisioned to provide a system approach for managing congested urban corridors. A simulation-based case study is presented for the US-75 corridor in Dallas, Texas.

The energy consumptions associated with the segments of the road network are derived from the measurements of the traffic load based on vehicle probe data, using a mesoscopic traffic model and a physical vehicle consumption model. The resulting description of the network is time-dependent, thereby reproducing the variations in time of the traffic load in Ingolstadt. The results suggest that the average energy consumption associated with energy-optimal paths is approximately 10% lower than the average energy consumption associated with fast paths. Moreover, we find that energy-optimal paths differ from fast paths in more than 90% of the considered test cases and that the density of junctions has a strong impact on the average energy consumptions. Although the time dependency of the network description leads to an increase in the computation time of optimal paths, the query times of one of the evaluated methods are promising for practical applications.}

We envision the proposed framework as the foundation to an alternative or supplemental traffic operation and management system, which could be particularly helpful under abnormal traffic conditions caused by unforeseen disasters and special events. Each equipped vehicle, through the distributed protocols developed, keeps track of the average traffic density and speed within a certain range, flags itself as micro-discontinuity in traffic if appropriate, and cross-checks its flag status with its immediate up- and down-stream vehicles. The micro-discontinuity flags define vehicle groups with similar traffic states, for initiating and terminating traffic information aggregation. The framework is validated using a microscopic traffic simulation platform VISSIM and its built-in component object model. Vehicle groups are successfully identified and their average speed and density effectively estimated. The impact of market penetration rate (MPR) is also investigated with a new methodology for performance evaluation under multiple traffic scenarios. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework lends itself better to more congested traffic conditions for any given MPR. With 50% MPR, the framework is able to provide information coverage for at least 37.76% of the simulated roadway facility under various traffic scenarios. This indicates that proposed framework could be useful with an MPR as low as 50%. Even with an MRP of 20%, the coverage ratio, under relatively congested traffic, can still reach around 58.82%. The framework is able to provide accurate speed estimation at high spatial resolution for the simulated roadway facility. The maximum relative error is under 10% for relatively congested traffic even with MPR as low as 20%. When there is a wider range of speed distribution (less congested traffic), the worst-case maximum relative error is still under 15% when MPR=20%. The density estimation is more sensitive to MPR, and is more accurate under low demand and high MPR scenarios. As expected, the accuracy of both speed and density estimation increases with MPR for any given traffic scenario.}

abstract = {The area-based (i.e., non-lane based) heterogeneous traffic (as in developing countries) has significant differences from the lane-based homogeneous traffic (as in developed countries). In area-based traffic, drivers generally ignore the lane markings and perceive the entire road space while progressing longitudinally. The traditional car-following and lane changing models are not directly applicable to model such driving behaviour. This research aims to microscopically model the dynamics of the subject vehicle in area-based traffic flow. The modelling is conducted in two steps: area selection, and vehicle movement. In step-1, a multinomial logit (MNL) model is considered for selecting the area-based movement direction of the subject vehicle. The choice space of the subject vehicle is divided into numbers of realistic radial cones considering the possible moving directions of the subject vehicle in the next simulation time step. These radial cones form the alternatives for the decision of the subject vehicle. The attributes of the alternatives are defined in terms of angular deviation from the direction of the flow, spacing and relative speed. This model is calibrated and validated for both cars and motorcycles using real trajectory data, and the results demonstrate the good performance of the model. In step-2, a modified intelligent driving model (MIDM) is proposed to simulate the next position of the subject vehicle (along the selected direction as the outcome of the model in step-1). The parameters of the MIDM model are calibrated using real data for cars and motorcycles. The deterministic parameters for MNL model and the empirical distribution of the MIDM model parameters are utilized to stochastically simulate vehicle trajectories with the initial and boundary conditions determined by the real dataset. The comparison of the macroscopic properties between the simulated and real datasets provides promising results for the simulation applicability of the proposed modelling framework.}

A long- and short-term driving (LSTD) model is proposed to incorporate such changes into car-following driving behavior modelling. The long-term driving characteristics are extracted through a cluster analysis, and the changes after an external stimulus are identified and measured as the indicator of the short-term driving characteristics. NGSIM data are used to demonstrate the existence of LSTD characteristics, and the soundness of the LSTD model. Two classical car-following models (i.e. the intelligent driver model, Gipps’ model) are integrated with the LSTD model, and the integrated models show a promising performance as the errors decrease by 36.7% and 35.7%, respectively.}

Time use and travel are analyzed based on minute-by-minute time allocation pattern identification using sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering. The correlation between motifs group and sequence analysis finds substantial heterogeneity within the motif groups. The within motif group clusters of activity-based sequences show typical commuting, going to school, and resting patterns. We also find seven patterns that are not typical but have similarities across motifs in their temporal footprint and the variety of activities in each sequence. The paper provides a summary of the analytical steps and findings as well as next steps.}

Therefore, the ability to obtain valuable sets of data has become one of the key challenges for researchers. Traditional mobility surveys have many important limitations. In this situation, the potential of the use of smartphones and dedicated applications in the identification of individual travel behaviour seem very promising. We set ourselves a goal to indicate strengths and weaknesses of data obtained with this method and assess the perspectives of its use for the needs of public policies. For these purposes we prepared a low-cost mobile application and conducted a pilot study among students in Poznań (Poland). In effect, trajectories of more than 100 people with almost 3 billion of location data were collected. Based on a literature review and our results we discuss the main problems, limitations and challenges of the broader use of the data obtained with smartphones. In the conclusion, we argue that there is a huge and increasing potential connected with mobile phones, but still some important barriers exist including sampling problems, limitations in big data analyses and technological issues. Therefore, a broader use of smartphones in travel behaviour surveys seems to be rather a distant perspective.}

The method of cluster analysis was employed to identity commuter groups (from 3,893 motorists who responded to an on-road survey) with similar patterns of responses to the influence of traffic information. The resulting groups were defined as (a) route changers, willing to change route both on Interstate 5 and before leaving; (b) non-changers, unwilling to change departure time, route, or mode of transportation; (c) route and time changers, willing to change route and departure time; and (d) pre-trip changers, willing to change departure time, route, or mode before departure but unwilling to change en route. Knowledge of such groups and their behavioral characteristics is useful in designing advanced traveler information systems that seek to affect commuter behavior and increase the efficiency of current transportation facilities. This paper discusses the methodology used to derive the commuter groups and investigates their commuting behaviors, decision-making processes, and information needs.}

Each customer is serviced only once by exactly one vehicle, within fixed time intervals that represent the earliest and latest times during the day that service can take place. The objective is to minimize the total transportation costs, or similarly to determine the optimal fleet composition and dimension following least cost vehicle routes. The proposed method utilizes the basic concept of an AMP solution framework equipped with a probabilistic semi-parallel construction heuristic, a novel solution re-construction mechanism, an innovative Iterated Tabu Search algorithm tuned for intensification local search and frequency-based long term memory structures. Computational experiments on well-known benchmark data sets illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

An understanding of these services (e.g. to whom, where, when, and for what purposes do they provide service?) is critical for regulating, planning, and managing urban multi-modal transportation systems effectively. Unfortunately, little is known about ridesourcing travel because private companies providing ridesourcing services were not previously subject to data sharing requirements. Fortunately, the city of Chicago recently collected and released spatially (census tract) and temporally (15-minute interval) aggregated data on ridesourcing trips collected from private companies. This study analyzes the Chicago ridesourcing data to examine factors influencing ridesourcing usage. The study employs a random-effects negative binomial (RENB) regression approach to model ridesourcing usage. Determinants considered in the model include weekend vs. weekday and weather variables as well as census tract socio-demographics and commute characteristics, land-use variables, places of interest, transit supply, parking features, and crime. The model results indicate ridesourcing demand is higher on days when temperatures are lower, there is less precipitation, and on the weekend, as well as in census tracts with (i) higher household incomes, (ii) a higher percentage of workers who carpool or take transit to work, (iii) a higher percentage of households with zero vehicles, (iv) higher population and employment density, (v) higher land-use diversity, (vi) fewer parking spots and higher parking rates, (vii) more restaurants, and (viii) more homicides. The results also demonstrate a non-linear (and insightful) relationship between ridesourcing demand and transit supply variables. The paper discusses the implications of these model results to inform transportation planning and policymaking as well as future research.}

While earlier research has examined route choice preferences in relation to travel time and travel cost (or toll), there is little guidance on the influence of information provision mechanisms. By accommodating for information provision attributes, the proposed research contributes to our understanding of the design of an active traffic management (ATM) system by quantitatively estimating the inherent trade-offs across the various attributes affecting route choice. Specifically, the research designs and elicits data using a web-based stated preference (SP) survey to understand road users’ preferencesin the Greater Orlando Region, USA. In the empirical analysis, the data compiled is utilized to develop random utility maximization and random regret minimization based panel mixed multinomial logit models. Route choice behavior is modeled using a comprehensive set of exogenous variables including trip characteristics, roadway characteristics and traffic information characteristics. The model results are utilized to conduct a comprehensive trade-off analysis across various attributes for the two model frameworks. In this research effort, we also customize the trade-off computation for regret minimization model for accommodating variable interactions. The trade-offs results provide useful insights on travel information provision (when and how).}

In practice, some of these bookings are finally cancelled without loading any containers onto the ships, which leads to a low loading rate and revenue loss. However, deep analyses of container slot booking cancellation in container liner services rarely appear in the literature due to the lack of real data. The characteristics and patterns of the container slot booking cancellation are unclear from both academic and managerial perspectives. To fill this gap, this study first proposes a conceptual model for the container slot booking cancellation analysis in intercontinental shipping services. A case study on a container liner service between Asia and US west coast is then conducted based on the proposed model. The static and dynamic cancellation rates of voyage, the attributes of bookings, and the factors that may influence the cancellation behaviours are inspected and discussed. The primary findings of this study will benefit both the academic research on container shipping slot bookings and the practices of the slot cancellation control in container shipping company.}

It critically assesses the wide range of forecasting approaches applied to telecommuting and the reasons for the upwards bias. The appeal of the concept, combined with various interests are among the reasons for the optimistic forecasts. Methodologically, forecasts of telecommuting tend to emphasize technological change while underestimating the social implications which determine the adoption of such technologies. A choice theory is suggested as an alternative approach which can address issues related to human behavior in the context of technological change. The explanatory power of choice models is demonstrated and suggested for future analysis of technologies which entail extensive adaptation for adopters and institutions.}

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of measuring spatial and temporal variation in driver productivity on ride-sourcing trips. This variation is especially important from a driver’s perspective: if a platform’s drivers experience systematic disparities in earnings because of variation in their riders’ destinations, they may perceive the pricing model as inequitable. This perception can exacerbate search frictions if it leads drivers to avoid locations where they believe they may be assigned “unlucky” fares. To characterize any such systematic disparities in productivity, we develop an analytic framework with three key components. First, we propose a productivity metric that looks two consecutive trips ahead, thus capturing the effect on expected earnings of market conditions at drivers’ drop-off locations. Second, we develop a natural experiment by analyzing trips with a common origin but varying destinations, thus isolating purely spatial effects on productivity. Third, we apply a spatial denoising method that allows us to work with raw spatial information exhibiting high levels of noise and sparsity, without having to aggregate data into large, low-resolution spatial zones. By applying our framework to data on more than 1.4 million rides in Austin, Texas, we find significant spatial variation in ride-sourcing driver productivity and search frictions. Drivers at the same location experienced disparities in productivity after being dispatched on trips with different destinations, with origin-based surge pricing increasing these earnings disparities. Our results show that trip distance is the dominant factor in driver productivity: short trips yielded lower productivity, even when ending in areas with high demand. These findings suggest that new pricing strategies are required to minimize random disparities in driver earnings.}

Due to the large scale, the trajectory data have become a potential substitute for the widely used fixed-location sensors in terms of the performance measures of transportation networks. Specifically, for traffic volume and queue length estimation, most of the trajectory data based methods in the existing literature either require high market penetration of the probe vehicles to identify the shockwave or require the prior information about the queue length distribution and the penetration rate, which may not be feasible in the real world. To overcome the limitations of the existing methods, this paper proposes a series of novel methods based on probability theory. By exploiting the stopping positions of the probe vehicles in the queues, the proposed methods try to establish and solve a single-variable equation for the penetration rate of the probe vehicles. Once the penetration rate is obtained, it can be used to project the total queue length and the total traffic volume. The validation results using both simulation data and real-world data show that the methods would be accurate enough for assistance in performance measures and traffic signal control at intersections, even when the penetration rate of the probe vehicles is very low.}

This paper investigates, on the one hand, how travel information affects route choice behaviour, and on the other hand, the impact of the travel time representation on the interpretation of parameter estimates and prediction accuracy. To this end, we estimate recursive models using data from an innovative data collection effort consisting of route choice observation data from GPS trackers, travel diaries and link travel times on the overall network. Though such combined data sets exist, these have not yet been used to investigate route choice behaviour. A dynamic network in which travel times change over time has been used for the estimation of both recursive logit and nested models. Prediction and estimation results are compared to those obtained for a static network. The interpretation of parameter estimates and prediction accuracy differ substantially between dynamic and static networks as well as between models with correlated and uncorrelated utilities. Contrary to the static results, for the dynamic, where travel times are modelled more accurately, travel information does not have a significant impact on route choice behaviour. However, having travel information increases the travel comfort, as interviews with participants have shown.}

To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical driving agent architecture based on three layers (guidance layer, management layer and traffic control layer). This architecture has been used to develop centralized platoons, where the driving agent of the head vehicle coordinates other driving agents by applying strict rules, and decentralized platoons, where the platoon is considered as a group of driving agents with a similar degree of autonomy, trying to maintain a stable platoon. The latter decentralized model mainly considers an agent teamwork model based on a multiagent architecture, known as STEAM. The centralized and decentralized coordination models are finally compared using results from simulation scenarios that highlight safety, time efficiency and communication efficiency aspects for each model.}

Arrival Manager tools aim to improve arrival flows at airports. To do so they need reliable, accurate assessments of potential congestion and delay issues. This paper sets out a methodology for predicting and evaluating the operational state of the airport arrival system. This methodology is structured in two steps: the prediction stage and the reliability stage. The prediction model is based on a Bayesian Network approach, which reflects the stochastic and time-varying nature of airport operations. It also provides insights into the interdependencies between factors contributing to airport performance. The reliability model uses a Multi-State System structure, as the airport arrival system has a large number of performance levels. It is developed via a Markov process technique. By combining these prediction and reliability models we can assess the characteristics of the airport arrival system: stationary state, availability, performance and degradation. The methodology is applied to a case study at a busy European airport, using real data from peak traffic months. Results for the scenarios analyzed show that the factors that have a greatest impact on delay and congestion are the level of saturation at arrival processes, the time frame of the day (which determines the arrival declared capacity) and the meteorological conditions. Moreover, arrival states of congestion reduce the airport’s ability to maintain optimal performance rates. The model represents an evolution from the traditional corrective and binary vision of performance analysis towards a predictive and multi-state approach. The results can be applied to derive operational strategies and draw conclusions regarding arrival performance and management.}

A study of severity of CMCs in the state of Wisconsin was conducted by Lu et al. in 2010. Discrete choice models, namely ordinal logit and probit models were used to analyze factors related to the severity of CMCs. Separate models were developed for single and multi-vehicle CMCs. Although 25 different crash, roadway, and geometric variables were used, only 3 variables were found to be statistically significant which were alcohol usage, posted speed, and road conditions. The objective of this research was to explore the feasibility of GUIDE Classification Tree method to analyze the severity of CMCs to discover if any additional information could be revealed. A dataset of CMCs in the state of Wisconsin between 2001 and 2007, used in the study by Lu et al. was used to develop three different GUIDE Classification Trees. Additionally, the effects of variable types (continuous or discrete), misclassification costs, and tree pruning characteristics on models results were also explored. The results were directly compared with discrete choice models developed in the study by Lu et al. showing that the GUIDE Classification Trees revealed new variables (median width and traffic volume) that affect CMC severity and provided useful insight on the data. The results of this research suggest that the use of Classification Tree analysis should at least be considered in conjunction with regression-based crash models to better understand factors affecting crashes. Classification Tree models were able to reveal additional information about the dependent variable and offer advantages with respect to multicollinearity and variable redundancy issues.}

Three crowding metrics are considered: (1) the probability of getting a seat on boarding, (2) the expected travel time standing, and (3) the excess perceived travel time compared to uncrowded conditions. The methodology combines prediction models of passenger loads and alighting counts based on lasso regularized regression and multivariate PLS regression, a probabilistic seat allocation model and a bias correction step in order to predict the crowding metrics. Depending on data availability, the prediction method can use a combination of historical passenger counts, real-time vehicle locations and real-time passenger counts. We evaluate the prediction methodology in a real-world case study for a bus line in Stockholm, Sweden. The results indicate that personalized, predictive crowding information that is robust to varying data availability can be provided sufficiently early to be useful to travellers. The methodology is of value for agencies and operators in order to increase the attractiveness and capacity utilization of public transport.}

abstract = {In this study, we focus on how to optimize multi-type train scheduling problems in a practically available and computationally efficient manner. When solving the complicated train timetabling problem with overtaking operations for a congested high-speed rail corridor, a simplified approach is to predesignate a thin time interval from its origin station for each train. This setting is difficult and laborious in practice. What is more serious is that an imperfect setting may cause the expected solutions to be unreachable in many instances. To fundamentally get out of this thorny trouble, this study proposes a flexible scheduling framework that extends narrow time limitations to one-hour periods, which allows the trains to depart from any timestamp within the relaxed period. Further, a group of incompatibility constraints with a more compact form is formulated to mirror the coupling relation between train headway and regularity requirements. However, the relaxed time window increases the difficulty of obtaining the optimal or near-optimal solution under the standard Lagrangian-based decomposition framework. Therefore, an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is introduced for effectively eliminating the computational barriers that are due to its increased complexity. Specifically, a priority-based search sequence is employed by applying the associated dual costs during the solution of train-level path subproblems individually. Finally, a set of numerical experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and availability of the proposed approach.}

Thus, the emphasis is on obtaining reliable approximations to the quantities of interest quickly and with a limited set of inputs. The models account for the dynamic characteristics of airfield capacity and demand, as well as for some stochastic aspects of airfield operations. They are sensitive to airfield geometry, the operational characteristics of the airfield and of the local air traffic control system, and the characteristics of the local air traffic demand for airport access and services. Through its integrated structure, the decision support tool can account for interactions among operations at different parts of the airfield.}

abstract = {This paper considers offline dynamic OD (origin-destination) calibration problems for large-scale simulation-based network models. We formulate the problem as a simulation-based optimization (SO) problem and propose a scalable and efficient metamodel SO algorithm. For a network with n links and a problem with T time intervals and Z OD pairs per time interval, the corresponding SO problem is a high-dimensional problem of dimension T·Z. At each iteration of the SO algorithm, we solve a set of T independent analytical and differentiable metamodel optimization problems, each of dimension Z. The T analytical problems are constrained by n nonlinear equality constraints. Hence, they scale linearly with the number of links in the network and independently of other network attributes, such as the dimension of the route choice set or the link lengths. The temporal correlation, of the link performance metrics across time intervals, is approximately captured through the parameters of the metamodel. Since the T analytical optimization problems are decoupled and can be solved independently, the proposed approach scales independently of the number of calibration time intervals, making it suitable for the calibration of demand over numerous time periods. The approach is efficient and scalable. It is suitable to address high-dimensional calibration problems for large-scale network models. It is benchmarked on both a toy network and a Singapore network versus two general-purpose algorithms: SPSA and a derivative-free pattern search algorithm. The validation experiments indicate that the proposed method identifies points with objective function estimates that outperform the benchmark methods by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. As the problem dimension and the temporal correlation, across time intervals, increase, so does the magnitude by which the proposed method outperforms the benchmark methods. The Singapore case study considers a problem of dimension 16,200. This is 2 orders of magnitude higher than what is currently considered high-dimensional for continuous SO problems. The proposed method identifies solutions with an estimated objective function that is 1 order of magnitude better than those of the benchmark methods. It yields solutions that provide an average, across time intervals, improvement to link counts of 77%, compared to the benchmark methods. The case study also illustrates the robustness of the method to the quality of the initial points.}

While this type of data is relatively inexpensive to gather, it can pose multiple privacy risks, even if the location tracks are anonymous. In particular, an issue could be the possibility for an attacker to infer user location tracks from anonymous location data, which affects users privacy. In this article, we propose a new framework for analyzing a variety of privacy problems arising in transportation systems. The state of traffic is modeled by the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards traffic flow model, which is a first order scalar conservation law with a concave flux function. Given a set of traffic flow data, we show that the constraints resulting from this partial differential equation are mixed integer linear inequalities for some decision variable. These constraints allow us to determine the likelihood of two distinct location tracks being generated by the same vehicle. We then use these model-based reidentification metrics to train an artificial neural network classifier. Numerical implementations are performed on experimental data from the Mobile Century experiment, and show that this framework significantly outperforms naive reidentification techniques.}

While most previous work has focused on link travel time estimation, the method uses FCD observations for estimating the travel time distribution on a route. Potential biases associated with the use of sparse FCD are identified. The method involves a number of steps to reduce the impact of these biases. For evaluation purposes, a case study is used to estimate route travel times from taxi FCD in Stockholm, Sweden. Estimates are compared to observed travel times for routes equipped with Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras with promising results. As vehicles collecting FCD (in this case, taxis) may not be a representative sample of the overall vehicle fleet and driver population, the ANPR data along several routes are also used to assess and correct for this bias. The method is computationally efficient, scalable, and supports real time applications with large data sets through a proposed distributed implementation.}

abstract = {In the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), one of the most promising sub-functions is that of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Development of an effective ADAS, and one that is able to gain drivers’ acceptance, hinges on the development of a human-like car-following model, and this is particularly important in order to ensure the driver is always ‘in the (vehicle control) loop’ and is able to recover control safely in any situation where the ADAS may release control. One of the most commonly used models of car-following is that of the Action Point (AP) (psychophysical) paradigm. However, while this is widely used in both micro-simulation models and behavioural research, the approach is not without its weaknesses. One of these, the potential redundancy of some of the identified APs, is examined in this paper and its basic structure validated using microscopic driving behaviour collected on thirteen subjects in Italy. Another weakness in practical application of the Action Point theory is the identification of appropriate thresholds, accounting for the perception, reaction and adjustment of relative speed (or spacing) from the leading vehicle. This article shows that this identification is problematic if the Action Point paradigm is analysed in a traditional way (car-following spirals), while it is easier if the phenomenon is analysed in terms of car-following ‘waves’, related to Time To Collision (TTC) or the inverse of TTC. Within this new interpretative framework, the observed action points can be observed to follow a characteristically linear pattern. The identification of the most significant variables to be taken into account, and their characterisation by means of a simple linear pattern, allows for the formulation of more efficient real-time applications, thereby contributing to the development and diffusion of emerging on-board technologies in the field of vehicle control and driver’s assistance.}

abstract = {It is concerned that system-level benefits of connected automated vehicle control might only prevail in a far-future centralized control environment, whereas the benefits could be much offset in a near-future decentralized control system. To address this concern, this paper proposes a decentralized control model for connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at an isolated signalized intersection with a single-lane road where each connected automated vehicle aims to minimize its own travel time, fuel consumption and safety risks. To improve the computational tractability, the original complex decentralized control model is reformulated into a discrete model. A benchmark centralized control model is also formulated to compare with the decentralized control model. The DIRECT algorithm is adopted to solve the above models. Numerical results show that the decentralized control model has better computational efficiency (with an average solution time of 10 s) than the centralized control model (with an average solution time of 60 s) without significant loss of the system optimality (with an average of 3.91%). Finally, analysis on connected automated vehicle market penetration shows that the extra benefit of the centralized control model is not obvious either in under-saturated traffic (less than 1%) or at a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate in critically-saturated and over-saturated traffic (less than 3% when the market penetration rate is lower than 20%). The results suggest that, as apposed to the earlier concern, the near-future decentralized control scheme that requires less technology maturity and infrastructure investment can achieve benefits similar to the far-future centralized control scheme with much simpler operations in under-saturated traffic, or in critically-saturated traffic and over-saturated traffic with a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate.}

Recently, a stochastic seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average plus generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (SARIMA+GARCH) process has gained increasing notice for its ability to jointly generate traffic flow level prediction and associated prediction interval. Considering the need for real time processing, Kalman filters have been utilized to implement this SARIMA+GARCH structure. Since conventional Kalman filters assume constant process variances, adaptive Kalman filters that can update the process variances are investigated in this paper. Empirical comparisons using real world traffic flow data aggregated at 15-min interval showed that the adaptive Kalman filter approach can generate workable level forecasts and prediction intervals; in particular, the adaptive Kalman filter approach demonstrates improved adaptability when traffic is highly volatile. Sensitivity analyses show that the performance of the adaptive Kalman filter stabilizes with the increase of its memory size. Remarks are provided on improving the performance of short term traffic flow forecasting.}

Managing such a complex multi-modal system requires a holistic modeling framework of transportation network flow in terms of both passenger flow and vehicular flow. In this paper, we formulate and solve for spatio-temporal passenger and vehicular flows in a general multi-modal network explicitly considering multi-class vehicles, parking facilities, and various travel modes. Vehicular flows, namely cars, trucks, and buses, are integrated into a holistic dynamic network loading (DNL) model. Travel behavior of passenger demand on modes and routes choices is encapsulated by a multi-layer nested logit model. We formulate the multi-modal dynamic user equilibrium (MMDUE) that can be cast into a Variational Inequality (VI) problem. A simple flow solution performed at the origin-destination level and based on the gradient projection is derived from the KKT conditions and shown to efficiently solve for the VI problem on large-scale networks. Numerical experiments are conducted on a multi-modal network in the Pittsburgh region along with sensitivity analysis with respect to demand and management strategies. We show that many factors including the total passenger demand, parking prices, transit fare, and ride-sharing impedance can effectively impact the system performance and individual user costs. Experiments on a large-scale multi-modal network in Fresno, California also show our model and solution algorithm have satisfactory convergence performance and computational efficiency.}

However measuring and quantifying supply chain risk has proved an enormous challenge and this research contributes to this goal by developing a risk assessment scorecard, using conjoint analysis, for motor carrier firms. The resultant motor-carrier scorecard has been scaled from 300 to 900, to resemble the well-known FICO score for assessing consumer creditworthiness. Our scoring model enables motor carriers – and the firms that depend upon them in intermodal supply chains – to assess carriers’ ability to withstand major disruptive events, which are broadly defined as events which might lead to a significant drop in carriers’ income and profitability (e.g., such as that which occurred on September 11, 2001). Carriers with weaker risk scores (<600, on a 300–900 scale) are more likely to experience financial distress (and as a result possibly exit the industry itself); those with scores above 600 are less likely to depart. The model correctly identified 77 percent of motor carriers that ultimately exited the trucking industry following the significant environmental disruption caused by 9/11. Our computational experience indicates that the model accuracy, quantified in terms of Type I and Type II errors, compares favorably to prior results reported in the credit scoring literature.}

This paper provides a framework for the automated classification of pedestrian attributes such as age and gender based on information extracted from their walking gait behavior. The framework extends earlier work on the automated analysis of gait parameters to include analysis of the gait acceleration data which can enable the quantification of the variability, rhythmic pattern and stability of pedestrian’s gait. In this framework, computer vision techniques are used for the automatic detection and tracking of pedestrians in an open environment resulting in pedestrian trajectories and the speed and acceleration dynamic profiles. A collection of gait features are then derived from those dynamic profiles and used for the classification of pedestrian attributes. The gait features include conventional gait parameters such as gait length and frequency and dynamic parameters related to gait variations and stability measures. Two different techniques are used for the classification: a supervised k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and a newly developed semi-supervised spectral clustering. The classification framework is demonstrated with two case studies from Vancouver, British Columbia and Oakland, California. The results show the superiority of features sets including gait variations and stability measures over features relying only on conventional gait parameters. For gender, correct classification rates (CCR) of 80% and 94% were achieved for the Vancouver and Oakland case studies, respectively. The classification accuracy for gender was higher in the Oakland case which only considered pedestrians walking alone. Pedestrian age classification resulted in a CCR of 90% for the Oakland case study.}

For this purpose, an instrumented vehicle was used to collect data on the headway and speeds of two consecutive vehicles under actual traffic conditions. Shortcomings of the existing GM based models are identified, in particular, the stability conditions were analyzed in detail. A fuzzy-inference based model of car-following is developed to represent the approximate nature of stimulus–response process during driving. This model is evaluated using the same evaluation framework used for the GM models and the data obtained by the instrumented test vehicle. Comparison between the performance of the two models show that the proposed fuzzy inference model can overcome many shortcomings of the GM based car-following models, and can be useful for developing the algorithm for the adaptive cruise control for automated highway system (AHS).}

In this paper, we propose and assess how to use VANETs for collecting vehicular traffic measurements. We provide two VANET sampling protocols, named SAME and TOME, and we design and implement an application for one of them, to perform real time incident detection. The proposed framework is validated through simulations of both vehicular micro-mobility and communications on the 68km highway that surrounds Rome, Italy. Vehicular traffic is generated based on a large real GPS traces set measured on the same highway, involving about ten thousand vehicles over many days. We show that the sampling monitoring protocol, SAME, collects data in few seconds with relative errors less than 10%, whereas the exhaustive protocol TOME allows almost fully accurate estimates within few tens of seconds. We also investigate the effect of a limited deployment of the VANET technology on board of vehicles. Both traffic monitoring and incident detection are shown to still be feasible with just 50% of equipped vehicles.}

The development of automated procedures for cooperative vehicle merging is aimed to ensure safety and alleviate congestion problems. In this work, a longitudinal trajectory planning methodology is presented, developed to assist the merging of vehicles on highways; it achieves safe and traffic-efficient merging, while minimizing the engine effort and passenger discomfort through the minimization of acceleration and its first and second derivatives during the merging maneuver. The problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and is solved analytically. This enables the solution to be stored on-board, saving computational time and rendering the methodology suitable for practical applications. The tunable weights, used for taking into account the different optimization criteria, may serve as parameters to match the individual driver’s preferences. The proposed methodology is first developed for a pair of cooperating vehicles, a merging one and its putative leader. Moreover, an alternative solution procedure via a time-variant Linear-Quadratic Regulator approach is also presented. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is utilized to compensate possible disturbances in the trajectories of the cooperating vehicles, whereby the analytical optimal solution is applied repeatedly in real time, using updated measurements, until the merging procedure is actually finalized. Subsequently, the methodology is generalized for a set of vehicles inside the merging area. Various numerical simulations illustrate the validity and applicability of the method.}

abstract = {A number of studies in the last decade have argued that Global Positioning Systems (GPS) based survey offer the potential to replace traditional travel diary surveys. GPS-based surveys impose lower respondent burden, offer greater spatiotemporal precision and incur fewer monetary costs. However, GPS-based surveys do not collect certain key inputs required for the estimation of travel demand models, such as the travel mode(s) taken or the trip purpose, relying instead on data-processing procedures to infer this information. This study assesses the impact that errors in inference can have on travel demand models estimated using data from GPS-based surveys and proposes ways in which these errors can be controlled for during both data collection and model estimation. We use simulated datasets to compare performance across different sample sizes, inference accuracies, model complexities and estimation methods. Findings from the simulated datasets are corroborated with real data collected from individuals living in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States. Results indicate that the benefits of using GPS-based surveys will vary significantly, depending upon the sample size of the data, the accuracy of the inference algorithm and the desired complexity of the travel demand model specification. In many cases, gains in the volume of data that can potentially be retrieved using GPS devices are found to be offset by the loss in quality caused by inaccuracies in inference. This study makes the argument that passively collected GPS-based surveys may never entirely replace surveys that require active interaction with study participants.}

After estimation, it is common practice to use aggregate measurements to calibrate the estimated model-system’s parameters prior to their application in transportation planning, policy making, and operations. However, calibration of activity-based model-systems has received much less attention. Existing calibration approaches are myopic heuristics in the sense that they do not consider the fundamental inter-dependencies among choice-models and do not have a systematic way to adjust model parameters. Also, other purely simulation-based approaches do not perform well in large-scale applications. In this study, we focus on utility-maximizing nested logit activity-based model-systems and calibrating aggregate statistics such as activity shares, mode shares, time-dependent & mode-specific OD flows, and time-dependent & mode-specific sensor counts. We formulate the calibration problem as a simulation-based optimization problem and propose a stochastic gradient-based solution procedure to solve it. The solution procedure relies on microsimulation to calculate expectations of the aggregate statistics of interest to the calibration problem. Additionally, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the gradient of the objective function —that are evaluated through microsimulation on mini-batches of the population. The proposed solution procedure is sensitive to the fundamental structure of the activity-based model-system and is non-myopic in considering the dependencies across its model components. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, highly nonlinear, and potentially has multiple-minima. Finally, we show —through a real-world application— that the proposed solution procedure outperforms other state-of-the-art purely simulation-based optimization approaches in terms of computational efficiency, stability, and convergence. We also compare various gradient-based solution algorithms to determine the best algorithm to update the parameters. This work has the potential to facilitate wider and easier application of activity-based model-systems.}

In this paper, a completely artificial intelligence car-following model, which has no analytical model incorporated, is developed to accurately imitate a human driver. This model comprises the classic stimulus–response framework, an extensive five-layer structure, Perception–Anticipation–Inference–Strategy–Action, and a fuzzy logic-based inference mechanism. A genetic algorithm is employed to calibrate the parameters of this model. The results of experiments, which were conducted by using Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset to validate the proposed model, indicate that the vehicle trajectories simulated by this model coincide with the actual vehicle trajectories in terms of mean value and deviation. In addition, they show that the proposed model has very good stability.}

Levels of congestion are estimated based on the velocity vector field obtained from the analysis of video recordings of moving crowds. By using data collected during supervised experiments, we show that the so-called “congestion level” allows to define a threshold for congestion under safe conditions and to measure the smoothness of pedestrian flows. The proposed approach has been compared with alternative quantities such as density, flow or the “crowd pressure” showing a more universal and consistent description of crowd motion. Later, the “crowd danger” of different pedestrian streams has been computed confirming that multidirectional motion is more dangerous than unidirectional one for equal levels of density. From a more practical perspective, the congestion level allowed to get a complete picture of the region in front of bottlenecks and to identify the formation of organized structures also under constant density and flow conditions. In addition, since only velocities are used in the computational process of the congestion level, it is more suitable for applications involving computer vision and emerging technologies, since density is usually difficult to obtain in very crowded situations. The congestion level and the crowd danger may help in the design of pedestrian facilities by simplifying interpretation of results from simulation and efficiently identify hotspots or design flaws. Finally, crowd control may benefit from the methods presented by potentially allowing a clear identification of dangerous locations during mass events.}

Timely and accurate traffic forecasting results are necessary inputs for advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) and advanced traveler information systems (ATIS). Despite the proliferation of advanced methodologies, modeling the uncertainty of traffic conditions is still a challenge, especially during congested situations. This paper presents a hybrid model for multi-step ahead traffic flow forecasting in a freeway system with real-time traffic flow data. This proposed methodology forecasts traffic flow by decomposing the data into three modeling components: an intra-day or periodic trend by introducing the spectral analysis technique, a deterministic part modeled by the ARIMA model, and the volatility estimated by the GJR-GARCH model. The aim of this study is to provide deeper insights into underlining traffic patterns and to improve the prediction accuracy and reliability by modeling these patterns separately. The forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model is investigated with real time freeway traffic flow data from Houston, Texas. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to unearth the underlying periodic characteristics and volatility nature of traffic flow data and show promising abilities in improving the accuracy and reliability of freeway traffic flow forecasting in multi-step ahead forecasting.}

Unfortunately in the US, currently available commercial vehicle data contain critical gaps when it comes to linking vehicle and operational characteristics. Leveraging existing traffic sensor infrastructure, we developed a novel, readily implementable approach of integrating two complementary data collection devices, Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) systems and advanced inductive loop detectors (ILD), to produce high resolution truck data. For each vehicle traversing a WIM site, an inductive signature was collected along with WIM measurements such as axle spacing and weight which were then used as inputs to a series of truck body classification models that encompass all truck classes in the most common axle-based Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) classification scheme in the US. Since body configuration can be linked to commodity carried, drive and duty cycle, and other distinct operating characteristics, body class data is undeniably useful for freight planning and air quality monitoring. A multiple classifier systems (MCS) method was adopted to increase the classification accuracy for minority body classes. In all, eight separate body classifications models were developed from an extensive data set of 18,967 truck records distinguishing an unprecedented total of 23 single unit truck and 31 single and semi-trailer body configurations, each with over 80% correct classification rates (CCR). Remarkably, the body class model for five axle semi-tractor trailers – the most diverse truck category – achieved MCS CCRs above 85% for several industry specific classes including refrigerated and non-refrigerated intermodal containers, livestock, and logging trailers.}

abstract = {There is substantial evidence to indicate that route choice in urban areas is complex cognitive process, conducted under uncertainty and formed on partial perspectives. Yet, conventional route choice models continue make simplistic assumptions around the nature of human cognitive ability, memory and preference. In this paper, a novel framework for route choice in urban areas is introduced, aiming to more accurately reflect the uncertain, bounded nature of route choice decision making. Two main advances are introduced. The first involves the definition of a hierarchical model of space representing the relationship between urban features and human cognition, combining findings from both the extensive previous literature on spatial cognition and a large route choice dataset. The second advance involves the development of heuristic rules for route choice decisions, building upon the hierarchical model of urban space. The heuristics describe the process by which quick, ‘good enough’ decisions are made when individuals are faced with uncertainty. This element of the model is once more constructed and parameterised according to findings from prior research and the trends identified within a large routing dataset. The paper outlines the implementation of the framework within a real-world context, validating the results against observed behaviours. Conclusions are offered as to the extension and improvement of this approach, outlining its potential as an alternative to other route choice modelling frameworks.}

abstract = {Three decades of research studies in ground delay program (GDP) decision-making, and air traffic flow management in general, have produced several analytical models and decision support tools to design GDPs with minimum delay costs. Most of these models are centralized, i.e., the central authority almost completely decides the GDP design by optimizing certain centralized objectives. In this paper, we assess the benefits of an airline-driven decentralized approach for designing GDPs. The motivation for an airline-driven approach is the ability to incorporate the inherent differences between airlines when prioritizing, and responding to, different GDP designs. Such differences arise from the airlines’ diverse business objectives and operational characteristics. We develop an integrated platform for simulating flight operations during GDPs, an airline recovery module for mimicking the recovery actions of each individual airline under a GDP, and an algorithm for fast solution of the recovery problems to optimality. While some of the individual analytical components of our framework, model and algorithm share certain similarities with those used by previous researchers, to the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive platform for simulating and optimizing airline operations under a GDP and is the most important technological contribution of this paper. Using this framework, we conduct detailed computational experiments based on actual schedule data at three of the busiest airports in the United States. We choose the recently developed Majority Judgment voting and grading method as our airline-driven decentralized approach for GDP design because of the superior theoretical and practical benefits afforded by this approach as shown by multiple recent studies. The results of our evaluation suggest that adopting this airline-driven approach in designing the GDPs consistently and significantly reduces airport-wide delay costs compared to the state-of-the-research centralized approaches. Moreover, the cost reduction benefits of the resultant airline-driven GDP designs are equitably distributed across different airlines.}

Most of such route information and features are actually constraints to the optimal vehicle speed control problem, but these constraints are described in two different domains. The most important concept in solving this problem is to convert the distance-domain route constraints to some time-domain state and input constraints that can be handled by optimization methods such as dynamic programming (DP). Multiple techniques including cost-to-go function interpolation and parallel computing are used to reduce the computation of DP and make the problem solvable within a reasonable amount of time on a personal computer.}

Furthermore, the existing Quickest Path Problem with Time Windows (QPPTW) algorithm is adapted to use fuzzy taxi time estimates.

To achieve this, we introduce a metric called Stickiness Index to quantify the range of preferences of users that always select to travel on the same route (high stickiness) to those with a more varied patterns of route selection (low stickiness). Adopting a visual analytic and modelling approach using a suite of regression models we find evidence to suggest that stickiness varies across the metropolitan area and over a 24-h period wherein higher stickiness is associated with high frequency users where there is substantial variability of route travel times across all alternatives. We argue that our findings are important in their capacity to contribute to a new evidence base with the potential to inform the (re)-design and scheduling of a public transit systems through unveiling the complexities of transit behaviour.}

Even though alternative fuel vehicles such as all-electric vehicles will be the best solution in the future, mitigating emissions by existing gasoline vehicles is an alternative countermeasure in the near term. The aim of this study is to predict the vehicle CO2 emission per kilometer and determine an eco-friendly path that results in minimum CO2 emissions while satisfying travel time budget. The vehicle CO2 emission model is derived based on the theory of vehicle dynamics. Particularly, the difficult-to-measure variables are substituted by parameters to be estimated. The model parameters can be estimated by using the current probe vehicle systems. An eco-routing approach combining the weighting method and k-shortest path algorithm is developed to find the optimal path along the Pareto frontier. The vehicle CO2 emission model and eco-routing approach are validated in a large-scale transportation network in Toyota city, Japan. The relative importance analysis indicates that the average speed has the largest impact on vehicle CO2 emission. Specifically, the benefit trade-off between CO2 emission reduction and the travel time buffer is discussed by carrying out sensitivity analysis in a network-wide scale. It is found that the average reduction in CO2 emissions achieved by the eco-friendly path reaches a maximum of around 11% when the travel time buffer is set to around 10%.}

Optimal routing in transportation networks with highly varying traffic conditions is a challenging problem due to the stochastic nature of travel-times on links of the network. The definition of optimality criteria and the design of solution methods must account for the random nature of the travel-time on each link. Most common routing algorithms consider the expected value of link travel-time as a sufficient statistic for the problem and produce least expected travel-time paths without consideration of travel-time variability. However, in numerous practical settings the reliability of the route is also an important decision factor. In this article, we consider the following optimality criterion: maximizing the probability of arriving on time at a destination given a departure time and a time budget. We present an efficient algorithm for finding an optimal routing policy with a well bounded computational complexity, improving on an existing solution that takes an unbounded number of iterations to converge to the optimal solution. A routing policy is an adaptive algorithm that determines the optimal solution based on en route travel-times and therefore provides better reliability guarantees than an a priori solution. Novel speed-up techniques to efficiently compute the adaptive optimal strategy and methods to prune the search space of the problem are also investigated. Finally, an extension of this algorithm which allows for both time-varying traffic conditions and spatio-temporal correlations of link travel-time distributions is presented. The dramatic runtime improvements provided by the algorithm are demonstrated for practical scenarios in California.}

abstract = {Time-stamped data for transportation and logistics are essential for estimating times on transportation legs and times between successive stages in logistic processes. Often these data are subject to recording errors and omissions. Matches must then be inferred from the time stamps alone because identifying keys are unavailable, suppressed to preserve confidentiality, or ambiguous because of missing observations. We present an integer programming (IP) model developed for matching successive events in such situations and illustrate its application in three problem settings involving (a) airline operations at an airport, (b) taxi service between an airport and a train station, and (c) taxi services from an airport. With data from the third setting (where a matching key was available), we illustrate the robustness of estimates for median and mean times between events under different random rates for “failure to record”, different screening criteria for outliers, and different target times used in the IP objective. The IP model proves to be a tractable and informative tool for data matching and data cleaning, with a wide range of potential applications.}

Then, a Classification and Regression Trees methodology is used to determine the temporal patterns of ADTT, SDTT, and CoV, again for all time periods and weather conditions. Finally, the identified temporal patterns are discussed with respect to the findings and assumptions of value of time (VOT), value of reliability (VOR), and mode choice studies in the literature. The analysis shows that traditional peak hours are not necessarily the most congested periods and that the peak periods also exhibit inter-period heterogeneity in terms of ATT and SDTT. As opposed to ATT and SDTT, the coefficient of variation was shown to exhibit more consistent patterns among the days. In this respect, caution is advised for VOT–VOR studies regarding the temporal discrepancies in ATT and SDTT patterns; and CoV is suggested to be considered in VOT studies as a more robust measure. In terms of weather impacts, inclement weather is shown to have the potential to decrease SDTT and CoV at certain time periods, resulting in higher travel time reliability. This counter-intuitive finding is discussed with regards to traveler perceptions and possible implications on route and mode choice.}

We find evidence that TNC entry appears to cause a decline in state per-capita vehicle registrations by 3%, on average (95% confidence interval: 0.7–5.5%). Our results regarding travel distances, gasoline consumption, and several air pollutants are not conclusive, but we find evidence of a negative relationship with some EPA-estimated vehicle air emissions, representing a decline of $300 million to $900 million in externalities during the analysis period. However, these air emissions data are modeled, rather than directly measured, so we are cautious about causal interpretations, and uncertainty in the effects of TNC entry on travel distances and gasoline consumption suggests potential additional externality effects that could dominate the air emissions effect.}

The intersection of limits to government support with the growing mobility needs of the elderly and of people with disabilities calls for the development of tools that enable us to better prioritise investment in those areas that would deliver the greatest benefits to travellers. In principle and, to a lesser extent, in practice, many trains and buses are already accessible to nearly all users, leaving the stations and interchanges as the single largest and most expensive challenge facing operators trying to improve overall access to the network. Focussing on travel time and interchange differences, we present a method that uses network science and spatio-temporal analysis to rank stations in a way that minimises the divergence between accessible and non-accessible routes. Taking London as case study, we show that 50% of the most frequently followed journeys become 50% longer when wheelchair accessibility becomes a constraint. Prioritising accessibility upgrades using our network approach yields a total travel time that is more than 8 times better than a solution based on random choice, and 30% more effective than a solution that seeks solely to minimise the number of interchanges facing those with mobility constraints. These results highlight the potential for the analysis of ‘smart card’ data to enable network operators to obtain maximum value from their infrastructure investments in support of expanded access to all users.}

abstract = {Aircraft mass is a crucial piece of information for studies on aircraft performance, trajectory prediction, and many other topics of aircraft traffic management. However, It is a common challenge for researchers, as well as air traffic control, to access this proprietary information. Previously, several studies have proposed methods to estimate aircraft weight based on specific parts of the flight. Due to inaccurate input data or biased assumptions, this often leads to less confident or inaccurate estimations. In this paper, combined with a fuel-flow model, different aircraft initial masses are computed independently using the total energy model and reference model at first. It then adopts a Bayesian approach that uses a prior probability of aircraft mass based on empirical knowledge and computed aircraft initial masses to produce the maximum a posteriori estimation. Variation in results caused by dependent factors such as prior, thrust and wind are also studied. The method is validated using 50 test flights of a Cessna Citation II aircraft, for which measurements of the true mass were available. The validation results show a mean absolute error of 4.3% of the actual aircraft mass.}

This paper proposes a non-parametric and data-driven methodology for short-term traffic forecasting based on identifying similar traffic patterns using an enhanced K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithm. Weighted Euclidean distance, which gives more weight to recent measurements, is used as a similarity measure for K-NN. Moreover, winsorization of the neighbors is implemented to dampen the effects of dominant candidates, and rank exponent is used to aggregate the candidate values. Robustness of the proposed method is demonstrated by implementing it on large datasets collected from different regions and by comparing it with advanced time series models, such as SARIMA and adaptive Kalman Filter models proposed by others. It is demonstrated that the proposed method reduces the mean absolute percent error by more than 25%. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed enhanced K-NN algorithm is evaluated for multiple forecast steps and also its performance is tested under data with missing values. This research provides strong evidence suggesting that the proposed non-parametric and data-driven approach for short-term traffic forecasting provides promising results. Given the simplicity, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed approach, it can be easily incorporated with real-time traffic control for proactive freeway traffic management.}

The model is a path flow-based optimization model, which incorporates heterogeneous sources of traffic measurements and does not require explicit dynamic link-path incidences. The objective is to minimize (i) the deviation between observed and estimated traffic states and (ii) the deviation between aggregated path flows and target OD flows, subject to the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) constraint represented by a gap-function-based reformulation. A Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm which dualizes the difficult DUE constraint to the objective function is proposed to solve the model. This algorithm integrates a gradient-projection-based path flow adjustment method within a column generation-based framework. Additionally, a dynamic network loading (DNL) model, based on Newell’s simplified kinematic wave theory, is employed in the DUE assignment process to realistically capture congestion phenomena and shock wave propagation. This research also derives analytical gradient formulas for the changes in link flow and density due to the unit change of time-dependent path inflow in a general network under congestion conditions. Numerical experiments conducted on three different networks illustrate the effectiveness and shed some light on the properties of the proposed OD demand estimation method.}

Driving data was logged and the test drivers were observed by means of an in-car observation method, in this case by two observers riding along in the car with the driver. Driver opinions were collected through questionnaires. The findings show positive effects of the system in terms of fewer alarm situations, shorter alarm lengths, shorter reaction times, increased headway and better interactions with vulnerable road users at intersections. On the negative side, driver performance worsened slightly, the number of centre line crossings increased, there was worse facilitating behaviour with regard to other drivers and harder braking at traffic lights. No major effect on speed behaviour of the driver, lane choice, lane keeping, lane change, overtaking, red running, use of turning indicator and workload was found.}

It is based on the data collected from an experiment using a dynamic interactive travel simulator for laboratory studies of user responses under real-time information. The experiment involves actual commuters who simultaneously interact with each other within a simulated traffic corridor that consists of alternative travel facilities with differing characteristics. These commuters can determine their departure time and route at the origin and their path en-route at various decision nodes along their trip. A multinomial probit model framework is used to capture the serial correlation arising from repeated decisions made by the same respondent. The resulting behavioural model estimates support the notion that commuters' route switching decisions are predicated on the expectation of an improvement in trip time that exceeds a certain threshold (indifference band), which varies systematically with the remaining trip time to the destination, subject to a minimum absolute improvement (about 1 min).}

While link-level travel time information can be derived or inferred from this data, methods for estimation of trip travel times between an origin and a destination pair are still evolving and limited, especially in the context of probability distribution estimation. This paper proposes a generalized Markov chain approach for estimating the probability distribution of trip travel times from link travel time distributions and takes into consideration correlations in time and space. The proposed approach consists of three major components, namely state definition, transition probabilities estimation and probability distribution estimation. A heuristic clustering method, based on Gaussian mixture models, has been developed to cluster link travel time observations with regard to their homogeneity and underlying traffic conditions. A transition probability estimation model is developed as a function of link characteristics and trip conditions using a logit model. By applying a Markov chain procedure, the probability distribution of trip travel times is estimated as the combination of Markov path travel time distributions weighted by their corresponding occurrence probabilities. The link travel time distribution is conditioned on the traffic conditions of the current link that can be estimated from historical observations. A moment generating function based algorithm is used to approximate the Markov path travel time distribution as the sum of correlated link travel time distributions conditional on traffic conditions. The proposed approach is applied in a transit case study using automatic vehicle location data. The results indicate that the method is effective and efficient, especially when correlations and multimodal distributions exist.}

Using GPS data collected from the real operation of 6,500 commercial vehicles over a period of three months, the proposed method was tested. In total, five profiles were constructed, accommodating activity-travel patterns associated with vans, cars, trucks-35 t (light trucks), trucks-3ax (medium trucks), and buses. Similarities and differences in these profiles across vehicle types were revealed, and specific locations corresponding to the activities of the patterns were further examined. Moreover, using these profiles as a reference, the travel practice of a specific vehicle was evaluated.

Due to the stochastic nature of the flow profiles, the paper devises a sampling process to estimate the probability mass function (PMF) of the link travel time. This sampling process defines a likelihood concept that measures the probability of the difference between the cumulative stochastic link inflow and outflow profiles to be less than or equal to a prescribed bound. Based on this likelihood measure, the probability mass function (PMF) of the link travel time is evaluated over an appropriate sampling interval. The PMF of the journey time is then evaluated by extending the deterministic nested delay operator to a stochastic version which is defined as a series of “nested” conditional probabilities of the link travel time PMFs along the route. This paper also proposes a method to fit the PMF of the journey time to a class of statistical distribution to determine its skewness, which is useful in the analysis of journey time reliability. The paper then analyzes journey time reliability via the properties of dynamic travel time distributions such as confidence intervals and shape parameters. The proposed algorithm is applied to estimate the stochastic journey time on a freeway corridor from the stochastic cumulative inflow and outflow profiles generated from the stochastic cell transmission model. This methodology is validated with two empirical studies: (i) estimations of journey time distribution and reliability analysis for one short freeway segment in California during a specific time period and (ii) the effects of traffic incidents on journey time reliability for a long expressway corridor of Hanshin expressway (between Osaka and Kobe) in Japan.}
