abstract = {Purpose
Safety climate, which is defined as workers’ shared perceptions of organizational policies, procedures, and practices as they relate to the true or relative value and importance of safety within an organization, is one of the best indicators of organizational safety outcomes. This study identifies key drivers of safety climate from the perspective of leader-member exchange (LMX). LMX is a theory describing the nature and processes of social interactions between a supervisor and a subordinate. This study examines the impact of individual drivers and combinations of drivers on safety climate through Bayesian Network simulations to predict practices which most effectively improve safety climate in the trucking industry.
Method
Survey data were collected from 5083 truck drivers in a large U.S. trucking company. Bayesian Network analysis was used to identify key drivers (factors) of safety climate and the best joint strategies for improvement. The impact of the drivers on safety climate was assessed and the simulation identified their potential impact independently and in concert with other drivers.
Results
The results from Bayesian Network analyses showed that the effects of LMX on organization- and group-level safety climate were conditionally dependent on four other drivers including psychological ownership, supervisory integrity, situation awareness, and safety communication. Among the five contributing factors, supervisory integrity and LMX had the strongest independent effects on organization- and group-level safety climate. Moreover, the results indicated that the best two joint strategies for promoting organizational (company/top management level) safety climate were LMX and psychological ownership as well as LMX and situation awareness, whereas the best two joint strategies for improving group (workgroup/supervisor level) safety climate were joint optimization of LMX and safety communication as well as LMX and psychological ownership.
Implications
Based on the study results, the strategies that may have the most potential to improve trucking safety climate are: enhancing leaders' ability to engage in high-quality exchanges (e.g., caring about employees), developing training to encourage employees/leaders to deliver on promises, and providing employees with more autonomy to enhance their ownership.},

abstract = {Hotspot identification (HSID) is one of the most important components in the highway safety management process. Previous research has found that hazardous sites identified with different methods are not consistent. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the performance of various HSID methods. The existing evaluation criteria are limited to two consecutive periods, and do not consider the temporal instability of crashes. In addition, one existing criterion does not precisely evaluate HSID method under given circumstances. This paper proposed three generalized criteria to evaluate the performance of HSID methods: (1) High Crashes Consistency Test (HCCT) is proposed to evaluate HSID methods in terms of their reliabilities of identifying sites with high crash counts; (2) Common Sites Consistency Test (CSCT) is proposed to gauge HSID methods in consistently identifying a set of common sites as hazardous sites; and, (3) Absolute Rank Differences Test (ARDT) is proposed to measure the consistency of HSID methods in measuring the absolute differences in rankings. Further, three commonly used HSID methods are applied to estimate crashes on Texas rural two-lane roadway segments with eight years of crash data. The performance of these three HSID methods were evaluated to validate the proposed criteria. Comparisons between the existing criteria and the generalized criteria revealed that: (1) the generalized criteria are capable of evaluating different HSID methods over multiple periods; and (2) the generalized criteria are enhanced with a consistent result and with less discrepancy in scores of the best identified HSID method.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a machine learning approach, the random survival forest (RSF) for competing risks, to investigate highway-rail grade crossing (HRGC) crash severity during a 29-year analysis period. The benefits of the RSF approach are that it (1) is a special type of survival analysis able to accommodate the competing nature of multiple-event outcomes to the same event of interest (here the competing multiple events are crash severities), (2) is able to conduct an event-specific selection of risk factors, (3) has the capability to determine long-term cumulative effects of contributors with the cumulative incidence function (CIF), (4) provides high prediction performance, and (5) is effective in high-dimensional settings. The RSF approach is able to consider complexities in HRGC safety analysis, e.g., non-linear relationships between HRGCs crash severities and the contributing factors and heterogeneity in data. Variable importance (VIMP) technique is adopted in this research for selecting the most predictive contributors for each crash-severity level. Moreover, marginal effect analysis results real several HRGC countermeasures’ effectiveness. Several insightful findings are discovered. For examples, adding stop signs to HRGCs that already have a combination of gate, standard flashing lights, and audible devices will reduce the likelihood of property damage only (PDO) crashes for up to seven years; but after the seventh year, the crossings are more likely to have PDO crashes. Adding audible devices to crossing with gates and standard flashing lights will reduce crash likelihood, PDO, injury, and fatal crashes by 49 \%, 52 \%, 46 \%, and 50 \%, respectively.},

Previous studies show that profound understanding of human drivers’ capability to interpret and anticipate traffic situations is required in order to provide similar capacities for automated driving technologies. There is currently not enough a priori understanding of these anticipatory capacities for safe driving applicable to any given driving situation. To enable the development of safer, more economical, and more comfortable automated driving experience, expert drivers’ anticipations and related uncertainties were studied on public roads. First, driving instructors’ expertise in anticipating traffic situations was validated with a hazard prediction test. Then, selected driving instructors drove in real traffic while thinking aloud anticipations of unfolding events. The results indicate sources of uncertainty and related adaptive and social behaviors in specific traffic situations and environments. In addition, the applicability of these anticipatory capabilities to current automated driving technology is discussed. The presented method and results can be utilized to enhance automated driving technologies by indicating their potential limitations and may enable improved situation awareness for automated vehicles. Furthermore, the produced data can be utilized for recognizing such upcoming situations, in which the human should take over the vehicle, to enable timely take-over requests.},

This has, in recent years, become a more severe problem than that caused by passenger vehicle-involved crashes. More studies need to be conducted in order to investigate factors that impact the severity of truck-involved crashes within specific scenarios. This study identifies and evaluates the factors that affect the severity of the truck-involved crashes at cross and T-intersections in North Carolina from 2005 to 2017. A latent class clustering for data segmentation is implemented to mitigate unobserved heterogeneity inherent in the crash data. Four partial proportional odds models, which include fixed and unfixed parameters, are developed considering the heterogeneous and ordinal nature inherent in severities. Estimated parameters and marginal effects are further investigated for better interpreting the impacts. Results show heterogeneous explanatory variables and associated coefficients for different classes and severity levels, which indicate the superiority of this combined approach to obtaining more specific factors and accurate coefficients that are estimated in different scenarios. Many factors are found to contribute to the severities, and crossroad scenarios are found to be more severe than T-intersections. The top five driving behaviors at intersections that contribute to the severity include disregarded signs, improper lane use, followed too closely, ignored signals, and failure to yield. These behaviors arouse a necessity to amend the traffic laws and strengthen drivers’ education while giving further insights to engineering practitioners and researchers.},

abstract = {Rationale
Car-driving performance is negatively affected by the intake of alcohol, tranquillizers, sedatives and sleep deprivation. Although several studies have shown that the standard deviation of the lateral position on the road (SDLP) is sensitive to drug-induced changes in simulated and real driving performance tests, this parameter alone might not fully assess and quantify deviant or unsafe driving.
Objective
Using machine learning we investigated if including multiple simulator-derived parameters, rather than the SDLP alone would provide a more accurate assessment of the effect of substances affecting driving performance. We specifically analysed the effects of alcohol and alprazolam.
Methods
The data used in the present study were collected during a previous study on driving effects of alcohol and alprazolam in 24 healthy subjects (12 M, 12 F, mean age 26 years, range 20–43 years). Various driving features, such as speed and steering variations, were quantified and the influence of administration of alcohol or alprazolam was assessed to assist in designing a predictive model for abnormal driving behaviour.
Results
Adding additional features besides the SDLP increased the model performance for prediction of drug-induced abnormal driving behaviour (from an accuracy of 65 \%–83 \% after alprazolam intake and from 50 \% to 76 \% after alcohol ingestion). Driving behaviour influenced by alcohol and alprazolam was characterised by different feature importance, indicating that the two interventions influenced driving behaviour in a different way.
Conclusion
Machine learning using multiple driving features in addition to the state-of-the-art SDLP improves the assessment of drug-induced abnormal driving behaviour. The created models may facilitate quantitative description of abnormal driving behaviour in the development and application of psychopharmacological medicines. Our models require further validation using similar and unknown interventions.},

abstract = {The study aims to identify relevant variables to improve the prediction performance of the crash injury severity (CIS) classification model. Unfortunately, the CIS database is invariably characterized by the class imbalance. For instance, the samples of multiple fatal injury (MFI) severity class are typically rare as opposed to other classes. The imbalance phenomenon may introduce a prediction bias in favour of the majority class and affect the quality of the learning algorithm. The paper proposes an ensemble-based variable ranking scheme that incorporates the data resampling. At the data pre-processing level, majority weighted minority oversampling (MWMOTE) is employed to treat the imbalanced training data. Ensemble of classifiers induced from the balanced data is used to evaluate and rank the individual variables according to their importance to the injury severity prediction. The relevant variables selected are then applied to the balanced data to form a training set for the CIS classification modelling. An empirical comparison is conducted through considering the variable ranking by: 1) the learning of single inductive algorithm with imbalanced data where the relevant variables are applied to the imbalanced data to form the training data; 2) the learning of single inductive algorithm with MWMOTE data and the relevant variables identified are applied to the balanced data to form the training data; and 3) the learning of ensembles with imbalanced data where the relevant variables identified are applied to the imbalanced data to form the training data. Bayesian Networks (BNs) classifiers are then developed for each ranking method, where nested subsets of the top ranked variables are adopted. The model predictions are captured in four performance indicators in the comparative study. Based on three-year (2014–2016) crash data in Ghana, the empirical results show that the proposed method is effective to identify the most prolific predictors of the CIS level. Finally, based on the inference results of BNs developed on the best subset, the study offers the most probable explanations to the occurrence of MFI crashes in Ghana.},

abstract = {Motorcycles and motorcyclists have a variety of attributes that have been found to be a potential contributor to the high liability of vulnerable road users (VRUs). Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) that include pedestrians, bicyclists, cycle-rickshaw occupants, and motorcyclists constitute by far the highest share of road traffic accidents in developing countries. Motorized three-wheeled Rickshaws (3W-MR) is a popular public transport mode in almost all Pakistani cities and is used primarily for short trips to carry passengers and small-scale goods movement. Despite being an important mode of public transport in the developing world, little work has been done to understand the factors affecting the injury severity of three-wheeled motorized vehicles. Crash injury severity prediction is a promising research target in traffic safety. Traditional statistical models have underlying assumptions and predefined associations, which can yield misleading results if flouted. Machine learning(ML) is an emerging non-parametric method that can effectively capture the non-linear effects of both continuous and discrete variables without prior assumptions and achieve better prediction accuracy. This research analyzed injury severity of three-wheeled motorized rickshaws (3W-MR) using various machine learning-based identification algorithms, i.e., Decision jungle (DJ), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). Three years of crash data (from 2017 to 2019) was collected from Provincial Emergency Response Service RESCUE 1122 for Rawalpindi city, Pakistan. A total of 2,743 3W-MR crashes were reported during the study period that resulted in 258 fatalities. The predictive performance of proposed ML models was assessed using several evaluation metrics such as overall accuracy, macro-average precision, macro-average recall, and geometric means of individual class accuracies. Results revealed that DJ with an overall accuracy of 83.7 \% outperformed the DT and RF-based on a stratified 10-fold cross-validation approach. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis showed that factors such as the lighting condition, crashes involving young drivers (aged 20–30 years), facilities with high-speed limits (over 60 mph), weekday, off-peak, and shiny weather conditions were more likely to worsen injury severity of 3W-MR crashes. The outcomes of this study could provide necessary and essential guidance to road safety agencies, particularly in the study area, for proactive implementation of appropriate countermeasures to curb road safety issues pertaining to three-wheeled motorized vehicles.},

For example, rear-end and side-swipe crashes are typically caused by improper vehicle interaction such as sudden lane-changing or speed control while hit-object crashes are likely the result of a single driver’s mistake. This study investigated the impact of vehicles travelling as a group (platoon) and its configuration (i.e., types of vehicles consisting of the platoon) on crash type and severity since the vehicles could affect each other when travelling in close proximity. This study applied Generalized Structure Equation Modeling (GSEM) to capture the complex relationships among the various crash factors such as traffic condition, driver characteristics, environmental conditions, and vehicle interaction to the crash attributes including type and severity. This study collected over 3 million individual vehicle data from 39 traffic count sites in California to estimate the vehicle interactions and driving behaviors. The microscopic traffic data are matched to 1417 crash reports. Results showed that vehicles traveling in platoons are associated with more rear-end and side-swipe crashes. Speed difference in the platoon had a positive effect on hit-object crashes if the platoon comprises vehicles of homogeneous type – either trucks or non-trucks. In addition, human factors such as age and gender were identified as significant influential factors in all type of crashes, however truck involvement particularly played an important role amongst side-swipe crashes. Crash severity was negatively affected by total flow, and rear-end crashes were more likely to be severe compared with hit-object crashes. Based on findings, this study suggests practical operational strategies to reduce traffic instability associated with platooned vehicle patterns. Understanding the high-risk factors for different crash types and severities would provide valuable insights for decision-makers and transportation engineers to develop targeted intervention strategies in consideration of road users and traffic conditions such as fleet mix and speed.},

An increasing number of driver assistance systems are already available in today’s automobiles; many of which are expected to become standard. Therefore, synthesizing the available evidence specific to the safety of AVTs is critical. The goal of this scoping review was to summarize this evidence with a focus on AVTs that require some driver oversight (i.e., Levels 0–3 as per the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) levels of automation taxonomy). A scoping review of research literature on AVTs was conducted for studies up to March 2018. Inclusion criteria consisted of: any study with empirical data of AVTs that included male and female drivers aged 16 years and older, healthy people (i.e., without impairments), passenger vehicles, driving simulators and/or large databases with road safety information that could be analyzed for the purpose of examining AVTs (SAE Levels 0–3), as well as measures of driving outcomes. A total of 324 peer-reviewed studies from 25 countries met the inclusion criteria for this review with over half published in the last 5 years. Data was extracted and summarized according to the following categories: measures used to evaluate the effect of AVTs on road safety (objective) and driver perceptions of the technology (subjective), testing environment, and study populations (i.e., driver age). The most commonly reported objective measures were longitudinal control (50 \%), reaction time (40 \%), and lateral position (23 \%). The most common subjective measures were perceptions of trust (27 \%), workload (20 \%), and satisfaction (17 \%). While most studies investigated singular AVTs (237 of 324 studies), the number of studies after 2013 that examined 2 or more AVTs concurrently increased. Studies involved drivers from different age groups (51 \%) and were conducted in driving simulators (70 \%). Overall, the evidence is generally in favour of AVTs having a positive effect on driving safety, although the nature and design of studies varied widely. Our examination of this evidence highlights the opportunities as well as the challenges involved with investigating AVTs. Ensuring such technologies are congruent with the needs of drivers, particularly younger and older driver age groups, who are known to have a higher crash risk, is critical. With automotive manufacturers keen to adopt the latest AVTs, this scoping review highlights how testing of this technology has been undertaken, with a focus on how new research can be conducted to improve road safety now and in the future.},

abstract = {Non-motorists involved in rail-trespassing crashes are usually more vulnerable to receiving major or fatal injuries. Previous research has used traditional quantitative crash data for understanding factors contributing to injury outcomes of non-motorists in train involved collisions. However, usually overlooked crash narratives can provide useful and unique contextual crash-specific information regarding factors associated with injury outcomes. The main objective of this study is to harness the rapid advancements in more sophisticated qualitative analysis procedures for identifying thematic concepts in unstructured crash narrative data. A two-staged hybrid approach is proposed where text mining is applied first to extract valuable information from crash narratives followed by inclusion of the new variables derived from text mining in formulation of advanced statistical models for injury outcomes. By using ten-year (2006−2015) non-motorist non-crossing trespassing injury data obtained from the Federal Railroad Administration, statistical procedures and advanced machine learning text analytics are applied to extract unique information on contributory factors of trespassers’ injury outcomes. The key concepts are systematically categorized into trespasser, injury, train, medical, and location related factors. A total of 13 unique variables are extracted from the thematic concepts that are not present in traditional tabular crash data. The analysis reveals a positive statistically significant association between presence of crash narrative and trespasser’s injury outcome (coded as minor, major, and fatal injury). Compared to crashes with minor injuries, crashes involving major and fatal injuries are more likely to be reported with crash narratives. A crosstabulation of new variables derived from text mining with injury outcomes revealed that trespassers with confirmed suicide attempts, trespassers wearing headphones, or talking on cell phones are more likely to receive fatal injuries. Among other factors identified, trespassers under alcohol influence, trespasser hit by commuter train, and advance warnings by engineer are associated with more severe (major and fatal) trespasser injury outcomes. Accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and controlling for other factors, fixed and random parameter discrete outcome models are developed to understand the heterogeneous correlations between trespasser injury outcomes and the new crash specific explanatory variables derived from text mining – providing deeper insights. Practical implications and future research directions are discussed.},

abstract = {Accurate real-time prediction of occupant injury severity in unavoidable collision scenarios is a prerequisite for enhancing road traffic safety with the development of highly automated vehicles. Specifically, a safety prediction model provides a decision reference for the trajectory planning system in the pre-crash phase and the adaptive restraint system in the in-crash phase. The main goal of the current study is to construct a data-driven, vehicle kinematic feature-based model to realize accurate and near real-time prediction of in-vehicle occupant injury severity. A large-scale numerical database was established focusing on occupant kinetics. A first-step deep-learning model was established to predict occupant kinetics and injury severity using a convolutional neural network (CNN). To reduce the computational time for real-time application, the second step was to extract simplified kinematic features from vehicle crash pulses via a feature extraction method, which was inspired by a visualization approach applied to the CNN-based model. The features were incorporated with a low-complexity machine-learning algorithm and achieved satisfactory accuracy (85.4 \% on the numerical database, 78.7 \% on a 192-case real-world dataset) and decreased computational time (1.2 ± 0.4 ms) on the prediction tasks. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using data-driven and feature-based approaches to achieve accurate injury risk estimation prior to collision. The proposed model is expected to provide a decision reference for integrated safety systems in the next generation of automated vehicles.},

abstract = {Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is a promising technique to improve the efficiency of signalized intersections, especially in the era of connected vehicles (CVs) when real-time information on vehicle positions and trajectories is available. Numerous ATSC algorithms have been proposed to accommodate real-time traffic conditions and optimize traffic efficiency. The common objective of these algorithms is to minimize total delay, decrease queue length, or maximize vehicle throughput. Despite their positive impacts on traffic mobility, the existing ATSC algorithms do not consider optimizing traffic safety. This is most likely due to the lack of tools to evaluate safety in real time. However, recent research has developed various real-time safety models for signalized intersections. These models can be used to evaluate safety in real time using dynamic traffic parameters, such as traffic volume, shock wave characteristics, and platoon ratio. Evaluating safety in real time can enable developing ATSC strategies for real-time safety optimization. In this paper, we present a novel self-learning ATSC algorithm to optimize the safety of signalized intersections. The algorithm was developed using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach and was trained using the simulation platform VISSIM. The trained algorithm was then validated using real-world traffic data obtained from two signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Compared to the traditional actuated signal control system, the proposed algorithm reduces traffic conflicts by approximately 40 \%. Moreover, the proposed ATSC algorithm was tested under various market penetration rates (MPRs) of CVs. The results showed that 90 \% and 50 \% of the algorithm’s safety benefits can be achieved at MPR values of 50 \% and 30 \%, respectively. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first self-learning ATSC algorithm that optimizes traffic safety in real time.},

However, the optimal observation time window length and prediction time window length, which should be the prerequisite for the timeliness and accuracy of real-time driving risk status prediction model, have been rarely explored in previous studies. In this study, a methodology which integrates driving risk status identification, rolling time window-based feature extraction, real-time driving risk status prediction and driving risk influencing factors analysis was proposed to accurately evaluate and predict real-time driving risk status. The methodology was tested based on 1,440 car-following events from Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. Results show that four driving risk statuses (safe, low-risk, median-risk and high-risk) are most appropriate to establish risk labelling criteria. In addition, results from driving risk status prediction show that when the observation time window length is 0.5 s, the accuracy rate of predicting medium-risk or high-risk status occurring in the next 0.7 s is higher than 85 \% using multi-layer perceptron model. Meanwhile, the results from the analysis of influencing factors show that the input variables related to the risk status score higher in the ranking of feature importance. A part from that, speed difference, headway distance, speed and acceleration are still important in predicting driving risk status. The proposed methods in this paper can be applied in connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) to reduce driver cognitive workload and hence improve driving safety fed with naturalistic driving data collected using in-vehicle systems.},

However, due to the insufficient understanding of the human driving strategy and style, the conflicts between ICVs and human drivers have arisen public attention, threatening the road safety and bottlenecking the development of ICV. In order to embed the human driving strategy in the intelligent driving system, researchers have been rolling out efforts on driver modeling. Most driver models, however, still suffer from the limited application scope or poor transparency. Within our finite horizons, a unified and readable driver model for various driving scenarios is generally unobtainable. In this work, we tried to model the human driving strategy from an aspect of human nature, that is, the way human drivers respond to the driving risk. We employed the risk field theory (also known as the safety field theory) to model the environmental risk in a comprehensive manner. By studying the risk-response strategy from the driving data of 24 human drivers, we proposed a unified structure, which we call the risk-response driver model (RRDM), to model the human driving strategy. This model provides access to learning not only the average driving strategy of a group of human drivers but also the specific driving style of a single driver. The explicit and readable driving strategy produced by RRDM can be directly employed to reproduce human-like longitudinal driving control. We verified the performance of our model in car-following tasks and found that its human-like driving performance is recoverable among the human drivers who participated in the tests.},

Consolidation programs help to close redundant crossings and thereby decrease the crash risks; however, it is difficult to find the best crossing in a neighborhood for closure. In our previous research working on HRGC consolidation models in 2019, from among four Machine Learning algorithms, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) performed better in HRGC prediction models. In continuation of our previous studies on developing a HRGC prediction model, this research employed Text Mining Techniques, and Geospatial Analysis in addition to the XGboost Machine Learning algorithm. The aim was to develop a consolidation model that is customized for local implementation. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 88 \% for the proposed model. The relative importance of the variables input to the model was also reported and offers an in-depth understanding of the model’s behavior. Considering the different correlation threshold, a sensitivity analysis was also performed on different aggregation gain values.

Utilizing crash data collected from fifteen states in the United States for the period 2013–2017, the association between distracted driving crash severity and various built environment indicators was examined by the generalized ordered logit regression model. The results show that at a lower severity level, DD related crashes were found to be less severe at roundabouts or in urban areas, whereas the probability of injuries rather than property damage only (PDO) increases if an accident involves speeding or when occurring at an intersection or a curved road. Comparatively, at a higher severity level, the odds of severe (or fatal) injury involvement compared to minor injuries and PDO was found to be higher in a work-zone, a curved roadway, or when excessive speed was involved. Conversely, roundabouts and urban areas affected negatively in severe DD crash, which is consistent with the lower-level case. The study also reveals a state-specific variability of the influence of the built environment on the severity of DD related crashes. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the severity of DD related crashes for transportation safety planners or policymakers to develop customized policy recommendations, such as designing policies or roadway safety treatments, to curb the negative consequences of distracted driving.},

model to address non-linear relationships by smoothing functions and
random effects such as unobserved heterogeneity (Faraway, 2016). In
addition, a latent segmentation-based ordered logit (LSOL) model may
also be adopted to capture heterogeneity or variation in crash severity
levels (Fatmi and Habib, 2019).
Last but not least, while the analysis was based on standardized data
of various states for comparison, it is worth noting that distracted
driving behavior tends to be underreported. Therefore, the pattern
revealed in this study may not fully capture the actual DD related
crashes. Future research should also focus on the utilization of different

order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the DD driving
behavior.}

abstract = {Run-off the road crashes account for a significant proportion of severe injuries to vehicle occupants. Traffic barriers have been installed with an objective to keep vehicles on the roadway, and prevent them from hitting natural obstacles like trees or boulders. However, still injuries and fatalities of barrier crashes account for high proportion of fatalities on roadway. Due to challenging geometrics characteristics of Wyoming’s roadway, a high mileage of barriers has been installed in the state. The high mileages of barriers result in a high number of barrier crashes in terms of crash frequency and severity due to high exposure. Previous studies mainly focused on crash frequency or individual crash severity. However, it has been recognized the importance of accounting for both aspects of crash severity, and crash frequency. So, in this study, crashes are aggregated across different barriers, and those crashes were converted into costs by considering the impacts of both crash severity and frequency. However, one of the main challenges of this type of dataset is highly skewness of crash data due to its sparseness nature. An improper use of model distribution of crash cost would result in biased estimations of the covariates, and erroneous results. Thus, in order to address this issue, a semi-parametric method of quantile regression technique was implemented to account for the skewness of the response by relaxing model distribution parameters. Also, to account for the heterogeneity in the dataset due to barriers' types, a random intercept model accounting for the structure of the data was implemented. In addition, interaction terms between significant predictors were considered. Understanding what factors with which magnitude contribute to the barrier crash costs is crucial for the future barriers’ optimization process. Thus, contributory factors to barriers crash cost with high, medium, and low values, corresponding to 95th, 70th, and 60th percentiles were considered, and a comparison was made across these models. It was found, for instance, that although factors such as rollover, driving under the influence, and presence of heavy truck all have contributory impacts on the cost of crashes, their impacts are greater on higher quantiles, or higher barriers’ costs. These models were compared from various perspectives such as intra class correlation (ICC), and standard error of coefficients. This study highlights the changes in coefficient estimates while modeling crash costs.},

annotation = {Not ML},
addendum = {For this study we just considered barriers with crashes as barriers
with no crashes did not have drivers’ characteristic such as alcohol
involvement, or citation record as a crash has not been occurred. Inclusion
of barriers with no crashes is important in the state as much of
the barriers are not based on recommended designs, and much of them
have not experienced any crash. To achieve the aforementioned criteria
the following analysis could be considered in the future studies to
incorporate barriers with no crashes as follows:
1 It is possible to only consider variables that are similar across barriers
with crashes and with no crashes. Those included predictors such as
barriers’ types, geometric characteristics, traffic, and barrier length.
That model could be implemented on both barriers with and without
crashes.
2 Instead of using cost as response, EPDO could be used. For this type
of response various model such as negative binomial could be conducted
on both barriers with and without crashes.
3 As negative binomial might not perform optimally for excess number
of zeroes, two component models, hurdle or zero-inflated models, are
expected to perform better. Those two-component models would
have two layers: one model for barriers with zero count crashes and
one model for barriers with crashes. In order to account for grouping
factor that we considered in this study; hierarchical model could be a
closest model to the implemented model in those studies.
As discussed, after identification of factors to barriers ‘crashes, the
final objective is to conduct cost-benefit analysis. This would be
implemented through quantile machine learning technique. The algorithm
would be trained over the original dataset. Then, variables especially
barriers geometric characteristics, such as barriers’ height would
be optimized to their optimal values. The trained model would be
implemented again over a new dataset and cost-benefit output would be
estimated.
For instance, barriers’ optimum height is 27 inches for box-beam. In
many places, the barriers’ height is less than that value. Thus, first the
cost would be predicted based on the barrier current height. Then, the
barrier’s height would be changed to 27 inches. The trained algorithm
would be conducted again, and cost would be predicted. The difference
would be the cost/benefit output.

This has been achieved by conducting simulated (and occasionally, field) driving experiments while collecting driver brain signals of various types. Here, this sector of studies is comprehensively reviewed at both macro and micro scales. At the macro scale, bibliometric aspects of these studies are analysed. At the micro scale, different themes of neuroimaging driving behaviour research are identified and the findings within each theme are synthesised. The surveyed literature has reported on applications of four major brain imaging methods. These include Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG), with the first two being the most common methods in this domain. While collecting driver fMRI signal has been particularly instrumental in studying neural correlates of intoxicated driving (e.g. alcohol or cannabis) or distracted driving, the EEG method has been predominantly utilised in relation to the efforts aiming at development of automatic fatigue/drowsiness detection systems, a topic to which the literature on neuro-ergonomics of driving particularly has shown a spike of interest within the last few years. The survey also reveals that topics such as driver brain activity in semi-automated settings or neural activity of drivers with brain injuries or chronic neurological conditions have by contrast been investigated to a very limited extent. Potential topics in driving behaviour research are identified that could benefit from the adoption of neuroimaging methods in future studies. In terms of practicality, while fMRI and MEG experiments have proven rather invasive and technologically challenging for adoption in driving behaviour research, EEG and fNIRS applications have been more diverse. They have even been tested beyond simulated driving settings, in field driving experiments. Advantages and limitations of each of these four neuroimaging methods in the context of driving behaviour experiments are outlined in the paper.},

The present study aims at utilizing crash narratives complemented by crash metadata to discern the prevalence and co-occurrence of themes that contribute to crash incidents. Ten years (2009–2018) of Michigan traffic fatal crash narratives were used as a case study. The structural topic modeling (STM) and network topology analysis were used to generate and examine the prevalence and interaction of themes from the crash narratives that were mainly categorized into pre-crash events, crash locations and involved parties in the traffic crashes. The main advantage of the STM over the other topic modeling approaches is that it allows the researchers to discover themes from documents and estimate how the topic relates to the document metadata. Topics with the highest prevalence for the angle, head-on, rear-end, sideswipe and single motor vehicle crashes were crash at stop-sign, crossing the centerline, unable to stop, lane change maneuver and run-off-road crash, respectively. Eigenvector centrality measure in network topology showed that event-related topics were consistently central in articulating the crash occurrence. The centrality and association between topics varied across crash types. The efficacy of generated topics in classifying crashes by type was tested using a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest. The classification accuracy in the held-out sample ranged between 89.3 \% for sideswipe crashes to 99.2 \% for single motor vehicle crashes. High classification accuracy suggests that automation of crash typing and consistency checks can be accomplished effectively by using extracted latent themes from the crash narratives.},

abstract = {Driving under the influence (DUI) is illegal in the United States because a driver’s mental and motor skills can be seriously impaired by alcohol or drugs. Consequently, DUI violators’ involvement in severe crashes is high. Motivated by the spatial and temporal nature of traffic crashes, this study introduces an integrated spatio-temporal approach to analyzing highway safety data. Specifically, this study estimates Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) models to understand the consequences of DUI in crashes. GTWR can theoretically outperform traditional regression methods by accounting for unobserved heterogeneity that may be related to the location and time of a crash. Using Southeast Michigan crash data, this study finds that DUI is associated with a 25\% higher likelihood of injury in a crash. The association between injury severity and DUI varies significantly across space and time. From the spatial aspect, DUI crashes in rural or small-town areas are more likely to cause injuries than urban crashes. From the temporal aspect, different times are associated with varying relationships between injury severity and DUI. If focusing on DUI crashes in late nights and early mornings, on Fridays, the entire northeast part from Clinton Charter Township to Port Huron is associated with severer injuries than other regions including Detroit’s urban area and its south. On Mondays, the DUI crashes in the northwest are also more likely to cause severe injuries. The methodology introduced in this study takes advantage of modern computational tools and localized crash/inventory data. This method offers researchers and practitioners an opportunity to understand highway safety outcomes in great spatial and temporal details and customize safety countermeasures for specific locations and times such as saturation patrols.},

abstract = {Providing drivers with real-time weather information and driving assistance during adverse weather, including fog, is crucial for safe driving. The primary focus of this study was to develop an affordable in-vehicle fog detection method, which will provide accurate trajectory-level weather information in real-time. The study used the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) video data and utilized several promising Deep Learning techniques, including Deep Neural Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Python programming on the TensorFlow Machine Learning library has been used for training the Deep Learning models. The analysis was done on a dataset consisted of three weather conditions, including clear, distant fog and near fog. During the training process, two optimizers, including Adam and Gradient Descent, have been used. While the overall prediction accuracy of the DNN, RNN, LSTM, and CNN using the Gradient Descent optimizer were found to be around 85 \%, 77 \%, 84 \%, and 97 \%, respectively; much improved overall prediction accuracy of 88 \%, 91 \%, 93 \%, and 98 \% for the DNN, RNN, LSTM, and CNN, respectively, were observed considering the Adam optimizer. The proposed fog detection method requires only a single video camera to detect weather conditions, and therefore, can be an inexpensive option to be fitted in maintenance vehicles to collect trajectory-level weather information in real-time for expanding as well as updating weather-based Variable Speed Limit (VSL) systems and Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS).},

abstract = {Traditional methods for identifying crash-prone roadways are mainly based on historical crash data. It usually requires more than three years to collect a sufficient amount of dataset for road safety assessment. However, the emerging connected vehicles (CVs) technology generates rich instantaneous information, which can be used to identify dangerous road sections proactively. Information about the identified crash-prone intersections can be shared with the surrounding vehicles via CVs communication technology to promote cautious driving behaviors; in the longer term, such information will guide the implementation of countermeasures to prevent potential crashes. This study proposed a deep-learning based method to predict the risk level at intersections based on CVs data from the Michigan Safety Pilot program and historical traffic and intersection crash data in areas around Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. One month of data by CVs at intersections were used for analyses, which accounts for about 3\%–12\% of overall trips. The risk levels of 774 intersections (i.e., low, medium and high risk) are determined by the annual crash rates. Feature extraction process is applied to both CV’s data and traffic data at each intersection and 24 features are extracted. Two black-box deep-learning models, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are trained with the extracted features. A number of hyperparameters that affect prediction performance are fine-tuned using Bayesian optimization algorithm for each model. The performance of the two deep learning models, which are black-box models, were also compared with a decision tree model, a white-box type of simple machine learning model. The results showed that the accuracies of deep learning (DL) models were slightly better (both over 90 \%) than the decision tree model (about 87 \%). This indicated that the DL models were capable of uncover the inherent complexity from the dataset and therefore provided higher accuracy than the traditional machine learning model. CNN model achieves slightly higher accuracy (93.8 \%) and is recommended as the classifier to predict the risk level at intersections in practice. The interpretability analysis of the CNN model is conducted to confirm the validity of the model. This study shows that combination of CVs data (V2V and V2I) and deep learning networks (i.e. MLP and CNN used in this paper) is promising to determine crash risks at intersections with high time efficiency and at low CV penetration rates, which help to deploy countermeasures to reduce the crash rates and resolve traffic safety problems.},

These driving aids include speed advisory, car-following assistance, lane-changing support, and advanced information about possible unseen hazards, among many others. While various studies have attempted to examine the effectiveness of different driving aids discretely, it is still vague how drivers perform when they are exposed to a connected environment with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication capabilities. As such, the objective of this study is to examine the effects of the connected environment on driving behavior and safety. To achieve this aim, an innovative driving simulator experiment was designed to mimic a connected environment using the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Two types of driving aids were disseminated in the connected environment: continuous and event-based information. Seventy-eight participants with diverse backgrounds drove the simulator in four driving conditions: baseline (without driving aids), perfect communication (uninterrupted supply of driving aids), communication delay (driving aids are delayed), and communication loss (intermittent loss of driving aids). Various key driving behavior indicators were analyzed and compared across various routine driving tasks such as car-following, lane-changing, interactions with traffic lights, and giving way to pedestrians at pedestrian crossings. Results suggest that drivers in the perfect communication scenario maintain a longer time-to-collision during car-following, a longer time-to-collision to pedestrian, a lower deceleration to avoid a crash during lane-changing, and a lower propensity of yellow light running. Overall, drivers in the connected environment are found to make informed (thus better) decisions towards safe driving.},

abstract = {Thorough evaluations on injury risk (IR) are fundamental for guiding interventions toward the enhancement of both the road infrastructure and the active/passive safety of vehicles. Well-established estimates are currently based on IR functions modeled on post-crash variables, such as velocity change sustained by the vehicle ($\Delta$V); thence, these analyses do not directly suggest how pre-crash conditions can be modified to allow for IR reduction. Nevertheless, $\Delta$V can be disaggregated into two contributions which enable its a priori calculation, based only on the information available at the impact instant: the Crash Momentum Index (CMI), representing impact eccentricity at collision, and the closing velocity at collision (Vr). By extensively employing the CMI indicator, this work assesses the overall influence of impact eccentricity and closing velocity on the risk for occupants to sustain a serious injury. As CMI synthesizes indications regarding $\Delta$V, its use can be disjointed from the $\Delta$V itself for the derivation of high-quality IR models. This feature distinguishes CMI from the other eccentricity indicators available at the state-of-the-art, allowing for the contribution of eccentricity on IR to be completely isolated. Because of this element of originality, special attention is given to the CMI variable throughout the present work. Based on data extracted from the NASS/CDS database, the influence of the CMI and Vr variables on IR is specifically highlighted and analyzed from several perspectives. The feature ranking algorithm ReliefF, whose use is unprecedented in the accident analysis field, is first employed to assess importance of such impact-related variables in determining the injury outcome: if compared to vehicle-related and occupant-related variables (as category and age, respectively), the higher influence of CMI and Vr is initially highlighted. Secondly, the relevance of CMI and Vr is confirmed by fitting different predictive models: the fitted models which include the CMI predictor perform better than models which neglect the CMI, in terms of classical evaluation metrics. As a whole, considering the high predictive power of the proposed CMI-based models, this work provides valuable tools for the a priori assessment of IR.},
institution = {U degli Studi di Firenze},
annotation = {Not our data.  Interesting for thorough analysis.},
addendum = {Notwithstanding the interesting highlights obtained, it is worth
evidencing that the analysis is focused on the determination of IR by the
MAIS 3+ index (serious injuries). The soundness of the results in terms
of Vr and CMI influence on the injury outcome can be extended by
studies focused on:
• a higher number of injury degrees (different MAIS);
• different injury severity indexes (e.g., ISS);
• an injury index which refers to single body segments (AIS).
This would additionally allow for a broader-spectrum study, employing
the models classified as most promising by the performed analysis.
The IR models which have been derived are valid for all collision
types, because the value of Vr and CMI is based on a posteriori data (by
$\Delta$V value and Eq. (3)); conversely, calculation of $\Delta$V by Eq. (2) may be
inappropriate if sliding occurs during the collision. However, in this
latter case, only a limited part of Vr is converted into $\Delta$V (low VrPDOF): a
low IR value associated with the collision is obtained and, as a consequence,
a lower relevance of sliding impacts in a priori analyses can be
highlighted if compared to full impacts.
It must be mentioned that the check applied to increase the quality of
the analysis (Eq. (6)) exerts a significant effect on the remaining number
of cases to be processed; however, this check can be modified or
excluded to include a higher number of accidents: even if more cases can
improve the fitting quality in practice, the use of partially incorrect data
can significantly affect the quality of the resulting model (Vangi et al.,
2019a). For what specifically concerns the derived models, it is worth
noting that they are obtained using American data only; given the differences
between distinct countries in terms of both data collection (in
procedure and accuracy (Fildes et al., 2013)) and crashworthiness of
vehicles (Flannagan et al., 2018), the proposed IR models need to be
modified and contextualized based on the specific scope. The
type-approval year of the vehicle model also affects the passive safety
datum: the registration year is considered as an indicator of the vehicle
generation (and crashworthiness) in the derived IR models because it is
the sole element available from the NASS/CDS database; considering the
type-approval year, rather than the registration year, could be beneficial
to enhance the overall fitting quality.}

Previous studies have separately analyzed crash severity in terms of monetary cost, injuries and loss of lives, and the size of crashes in terms of the number of vehicles involved. However, as both outcome variables are correlated, it is imperative to perform a combined analysis using an appropriate econometric model to achieve a better model fit. This study contributes to the literature by jointly exploring the factors influencing the severity and size of express bus-involved crashes that occur on expressways and characterizes the dependence between both outcome variables by employing a more plausible copula regression framework. Likelihood ratio tests were also conducted to investigate the temporal stability of the factors that affect both crash severity and size. Based on the goodness-of-fit statistics, the Frank copula model proved superior to the independent ordered probit model. The estimate of the underlying dependence between the outcome variables provided a better comprehension of the correlation between them. Temporal instability was detected for the individual parameters in the models and is attributed to the changing driving behavior due to the heightened road safety campaigns. The results suggest that traffic exposure measures are significantly associated with a higher propensity of observing increased bus crash severity and size. Insights into the factors influencing the size and severity of express bus crashes are discussed, and appropriate engineering, enforcement, and education-related countermeasures are proposed.},

Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to conduct single-vehicle crash severity prediction with different tree-based and non-parameter models. An alternate aim is to identify the intrinsic mechanism of how contributing factors determine single-vehicle crash severity. By virtue of Grid-Search method, this paper conducted fine-tuning of different models to obtain the best performances based on five crash severity sub-datasets. For model evaluation, the accuracy indicators were calculated in training, validation and test sets, respectively. Besides, feature importance extraction was undertaken based on the results of model comparison. The finding indicated that these models didn’t exhibit a huge performance difference for crash severity prediction in the same severity level; however, the performances of the models did vary among different datasets, with an average training accuracy of 99.27 \%, 96.4 \%, 86.98 \%, 86.84 \%, 71.76 \% in fatal injury, severe injury, visible injury, complaint of pain, PDO crash datasets, respectively. Additionally, it was found that in each severity dataset, the indicator urban freeways is a determinant factor that leads to the occurrence of crashes while rural freeways is more related to more severe crashes (i.e., fatal and severe crashes).

As it stands, road injuries are ranked among top-ten leading causes of death by the World Health Organization. Distracted driving is defined as an attention diversion of the driver toward a competing activity. It was shown in numerous studies that distracted driving increase the probability of near-crash or crash events. By leveraging the statistical power of the large SHRP2 naturalistic data, we are able to quantify the preponderance of specific distractions during daily trips and confirm the causality factor of an ubiquitous non-driving task in the crash event. We show that, except for phone usage which happens more frequently in near-crash and crash categories than in baseline trips, both distracted driving and secondary tasks occur almost uniformly in different types of trips. In this study, we investigate the impact of the co-occurrence of distracted driving with other driving behaviors and secondary tasks. It is found that the co-occurrence of distracted driving with other driving behaviors or secondary tasks increase the chance of near-crash and crash events.

Pedestrian and item detection has been performed by YOLOv3 and YOLACT models. The accepted and rejected time gaps were extracted for pedestrians, excluding the pedestrians who crossed between stopped vehicles and crossed when an approaching vehicle did not exist within 100 m from the midblock crossing. Raff’s method was used to estimate the critical gap using accepted/rejected gaps. The critical gaps ranged between 4.1 s and 6.2 s.

The data used in this study refer to the 6167 crashes occurred in the section Naples–Candela of A16 motorway, Italy in the period from 2001 to 2011. The analysis was carried out using the rule discovery technique due to its ability of extracting knowledge from large amounts of data previously unknown and indistinguishable by investigating patterns that occur together in a given event. The rules were filtered by support, confidence, lift, and validated by the lift increase criterion. A two-step analysis was carried out. In the first step, rules discovering factors contributing to ROR crashes were identified. In the second step, studying only ROR crashes, rules discovering factors contributing to severe and fatal injury (KSI) crashes were identified. As a result, 94 significant rules for ROR crashes and 129 significant rules for KSI crashes were identified. These rules represent several combinations of geometric design, roadside, barrier performance, crash dynamic, vehicle, environmental and drivers’ characteristics associated with an overrepresentation of frequency and severity of ROR crashes. From the methodological point of view, study results show that the a priori algorithm was effective in providing new information which was previously hidden in the data. Finally, several countermeasures to solve or mitigate the safety issues identified in this study were discussed. It is worthwhile to observe that the study showed a combination of factors contributing to the overrepresentation of frequency and severity of ROR crashes. Consequently, the implementation of a combination of countermeasures is recommended.},

abstract = {Given the severe traffic safety issue, tremendous efforts have been devoted to identify the crash contributing factors for developing and implementing safety improvement countermeasures. According to the study findings, driving behaviors have attributed to the majority crash occurrence, among which inadequate driving capability is a key factor. Therefore, a number of studies have been conducted for developing techniques associated with the driving capability assessment and its various improvement. However, the conventional assessment approaches, such as driving license exams and vehicle insurance quotes, have only focused on basic driving skill evaluations or aggregated driving style classifications, which failed to quantify driving capability from the safety perspective with respect to the complex driving scenarios. In this study, a novel longitudinal driving capacity assessment and ranking approach was developed with naturalistic driving data. Two Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) based driving capability indicators from the perspectives of risk exposure and severity were first proposed. Then, Bayesian Tobit quantile regression (BTQR) models were introduced to explore the relationships between driving capability indicators with trip level characteristics from the aspects of travel features, operational conditions, and roadway characteristics. The modeling results concluded that nighttime driving and higher average speed would lead to higher longitudinal collision risk and its severity. Besides, the BTQR models have provided varying factors significances among different quantile levels, for instance, driving duration is only significant at high quantiles for the driving capability indicators, implying that duration only affects drivers with large longitudinal risk exposures and strong close following tendencies. Furthermore, the case studies provided how to deploy the developed model to obtain the relative longitudinal driving capability rankings. Finally, the model applications from the aspects of commercial fleet safety management and comparing the autonomous vehicles’ longitudinal driving behaviors with human drivers have been discussed.},

abstract = {Traffic violations and improper driving are behaviors that primarily contribute to traffic crashes. This study aimed to develop effective approaches for predicting at-fault crash driver frequency using only city-level traffic enforcement predictors. A fusion deep learning approach combining a convolution neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent units (GRU) was developed to compare predictive performance with one econometric approach, two machine learning approaches, and another deep learning approach. The performance comparison was conducted for (1) at-fault crash driver frequency prediction tasks and (2) city-level crash risk prediction tasks. The proposed CNN-GRU achieved remarkable prediction accuracy and outperformed other approaches, while the other approaches also exhibited excellent performances. The results suggest that effective prediction approaches and appropriate traffic safety measures can be developed by considering both crash frequency and crash risk prediction tasks. In addition, the accumulated local effects (ALE) plot was utilized to investigate the contribution of each traffic enforcement activity on traffic safety in a scenario of multicollinearity among predictors. The ALE plot illustrated a complex nonlinear relationship between traffic enforcement predictors and the response variable. These findings can facilitate the development of traffic safety measures and serve as a good foundation for further investigations and utilization of traffic violation data.},

abstract = {The estimation of the effect of contributors to crash injury severity and the prediction of crash injury severity outcomes suffer often from biases related to missing data in crash datasets that contain incomplete records. As both estimation and prediction would greatly improve if the missing values were recovered, this study proposes a sequential approach to handle incomplete crash datasets and rank contributors to the injury severity of crashes on mountainous freeways in China. The sequential approach consists of two parts: (i) multivariate imputation by chained equations imputes the missing values of independent variables; (ii) a random forest classifier analyses the correlation between the dependent and the independent variables. The first part considers different imputation methods in light of the independent variables being either binary, categorical or continuous, whereas the second part classifies the correlations according to the random forest classifier. The proposed method was applied to the case-study about mountainous freeways in China and compared to the analysis of the raw dataset to evaluate its effectiveness, and the results illustrate that the method improves significantly the classification accuracy when compared with existing methods. Moreover, the classifier ranked the contributors to the injury severity of traffic crashes on mountainous freeways: in order of importance vehicle type, crash type, road longitudinal gradient, crash cause, curve radius, and deflection angles. Interestingly, a lower importance was found for environmental factors.},

Taking this observation as a starting point, this study examines the relationship between highway safety and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, using an extensive crash dataset from Kentucky. Its focus is single- and two-unit crashes that involve commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) and automobiles. Using binary logistic regression and the quasi-induced exposure technique to analyze data on the socioeconomic and demographic attributes of the zip codes in which drivers reside, factors are identified which can serve as indicators of crash occurrence. Variables such as income, education level, poverty level, employment, age, gender, and rurality of the driver’s zip code influence the likelihood of a driver being at fault in a crash. Socioeconomic factors exert a similar influence on CMV and automobile crashes, irrespective of the number of vehicles involved. Research findings can be used to identify groups of drivers most likely to be involved in crashes and develop targeted and efficient safety programs.},

In this regard, this research employed an integrated microsimulation modeling approach to assess the safety performance of the WYDOT CV Pilot. A 23-mile representative I-80 corridor was selected for developing the microsimulation models. Traffic flow and driving behavior data under winter snowy weather condition were collected to calibrate the baseline microsimulation model. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to quantitatively investigate the impacts of CV technology on driving behavior; accordingly, the driving behavior data under CV environment were employed to properly update the calibrated CV microsimulation models. The safety effectiveness of the WYDOT CV Pilot were assessed for various demand levels and CV penetration rates. It was concluded that WYDOT CV applications increased drivers’ situation awareness under adverse weather conditions, and thus reduced the crash risk. The reductions in conflicts displayed a decreasing trend with the increase of CV penetration rates, but the reduction was not significant when CV penetration was lower than 10 percent. The maximum reduction in conflicts was 85 percent when all trucks were equipped with CV technology.},

Post-sleep performance impairments due to sleep inertia, the transitional phase from sleep to wakefulness that can take up to 30 min, are a potential safety issue. Take-over performance immediately after sleep is impaired and drivers perceive the take-over as critical. The aim of the presented study was to assess take-over behavior immediately after sleep and driving behavior during the 10 min after sleep. A study with N = 31 drivers was conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Take-over performance and driving performance were assessed a) under alert baseline conditions and b) after awakening from electroencephalography-confirmed stable sleep. Take-over performance 15 s after awakening was impaired resulting in more driving errors compared to the alert baseline. Lane keeping was dramatically impaired in the first 3 min after sleep and recovered rapidly. Drivers drove slower after sleep and speed keeping was less stable for at least 10 min. The results suggest that human-machine interaction design should account for the drivers’ impaired post-sleep driving performance.},

Therefore, it is essential to identify the leading causes of crashes involving HAZMAT vehicles and make specific countermeasures to improve the safety of expressways. This study aims to employ the association rules mining (ARM) approach to discover the contributory crash-risk factors of HAZMAT vehicle-involved crashes on expressways. A case study is conducted using crash data obtained from the Korea Expressway Corporation crash database from 2008 to 2017. ARM was conducted using the Apriori algorithm, and a total of 855 interesting rules were generated. With appropriate support, confidence, and lift values, we found hidden patterns in the HAZMAT crash characteristics. The results indicate that HAZMAT vehicle-involved crashes are highly associated with male drivers, single vehicle-involved crashes, clear weather conditions, daytime, and mainline segments. Also, we found that HAZMAT tank-lorry and cargo truck crashes, single vehicle-involved crashes, and crashes on mainline segments of expressways had independent and unique association rules. The finding from this study demonstrates that ARM is a plausible data mining technique that can be employed to draw relationships between HAZMAT vehicle-involved crashes and significant crash-risk factors, and has the potential of providing more easy-to-understand results and relevant insights for the safety improvement of expressways.},

In this study, we attempted to explain drivers’ takeover performance variation in a level 3 automated vehicle in consideration of the effects of trust, system characteristics, environmental characteristics, and driver characteristics with a structural equation model. The model was built by incorporating drivers’ takeover time and quality as endogenous variables. A theoretical framework of the model was hypothesized on the basis of the ACT-R cognitive architecture and relevant research results. The validity of the model was confirmed using data collected from 136 driving simulator samples under the condition of voluntary non-driving-related tasks. Results revealed that takeover time budget was the most critical factor in promoting the safety and stability of takeover process, which, together with traffic density, drivers’ age and manual driving experience, determined drivers’ takeover quality directly. In addition, the pre-existing experience with an automated system or a similar technology and self-confidence of the driver, as well as takeover time budget, strongly influenced the takeover time directly. Apart from the direct effects mentioned above, trust, as an intermediary variable, explained a major portion of the variance in takeover time. Theoretically, these findings suggest that takeover behavior could be comprehensively evaluated from the two dimensions of takeover time and quality through the combination of trust, driver characteristics, environmental characteristics, and vehicle characteristics. The influence mechanism of the above factors is complex and multidimensional. In addition to the form of direct influence, trust, as an intermediary variable, could reflect the internal mechanism of the takeover behavior variation. Practically, the findings emphasize the crucial role of trust in the change in takeover behavior through the dimensions of subjective trust level and monitoring strategy, which may provide new insights into the function design of takeover process.},

This study aims at investigating –for the first time- rear-end conflict frequency in an urban network level using vehicle-to-vehicle interactions and at correlating frequency with the corresponding network traffic state. The Time-To-Collision (TTC) and Deceleration Rate to Avoid Crash (DRAC) metrics are utilized to estimate conflict frequency on the current network situation, as well as on scenarios including AV characteristics. Three critical conflict points are defined, according to TTC and DRAC thresholds. After extracting conflicts, data are fitted into Zero-inflated and also traditional Negative Binomial models, as well as quasi-Poisson models, while controlling for endogeneity, in order to investigate contributory factors of conflict frequency. Results demonstrate that conflict counts are significantly higher in congested traffic and that high variations in speed increase conflicts. Nevertheless, a comparison with simulated AV traffic and the use of more surrogate safety indicators could provide more insight into the relationship between traffic state and traffic conflicts in the near future.},

The environmental attributes were measured at eye-level using scene segmentation and object detection algorithms, and they were classified as one of four intersection typologies using the k-means clustering method. Data on perceived crash risk were collected from a questionnaire conducted on 799 children 10 to 12 years old. Our results showed that environmental features derived from deep learning algorithms were significantly associated with perceived crash risk among school-aged children. The results have revealed that some of the intersection characteristics including the proportional area of sky and roadway were significantly associated with the perceived crash risk among school-aged children. In particular, road width had dominant influence on risk perception.

The proposed algorithm was trained and evaluated on a simulated isolated intersection built based on real-world traffic data. A real-time crash prediction model was calibrated to provide the safety measure. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the real-world signal timing provided by the local jurisdiction. The results showed that the algorithm improves both traffic efficiency and safety compared with the benchmark. A control policy analysis of the proposed ATSC revealed that the abstracted control rules could help the traditional signal controllers to improve traffic safety, which might be beneficial if the infrastructure is not ready to adopt ATSCs. A hybrid controller is also proposed to provide further traffic safety improvement if necessary.

A new method of safety analysis based on failure-caused traffic conflicts and the Lomax distribution was recently proposed to estimate crash frequency more efficiently than with crash data. This paper has two objectives: (1) demonstrate the method applicability to near-departure data collected in a driving simulator, and (2) provide initial evidence of the method validity. Traffic failures and road users’ delayed responses to these failures is considered as the primary cause of both conflicts and crashes. Unlike early postulated exceedance distributions the proposed Lomax distribution of response delays was derived from the causal mechanism. From this perspective, the proposed method may use the entire range of the underlying distribution as long as the observed conflicts are failure-related. The fundamentals of the method are briefly explained with the emphasis on certain behavior of crash frequency estimates implied by the proposed theory. Then, an example application of the method to analyze the risk of road departures in a driving simulator is presented. The results are then inspected and the trend in the estimates derived from the theory is confirmed. This finding points to the method validity. Additional applications of the method are expected to further increase the confidence towards the method and to encourage its introduction to the safety engineering practice.},

We synthesise their scope with a particular focus on ensuring effective CAVs deployment and reducing the probability of cyber-attack failures. We present the CAVs communication framework in an integrated form, i.e., from In-Vehicle (IV) communication to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2X) communication with a visual flowchart to provide a transparent picture of all the interfaces for potential cyber-attacks. The vulnerability of CAVs by proximity (or physical) access to cyber-attacks is outlined with future recommendations. There is a detailed description of why the orthodox cybersecurity approaches in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) are not adequate to counter cyber-attacks on the CAVs. Further, we synthesised a table with consolidated details of the cyber-attacks on the CAVs, the respective CAV communication system, its impact, and the corresponding mitigation strategies.

The application of an eco-safe driving system is feasible with the support of vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure technologies. To guarantee system usability and safety appropriateness, a key precondition is to ensure that driver mental workload and visual demands required for using the system are reasonable. This study explored how drivers’ mental workload and visual demands were affected when driving with an eco-safe driving HMI (human-machine-interface). Four in-vehicle eco-safe HMI information conditions were evaluated, including baseline, advice only, feedback only, and advice \& feedback. Two traffic scenarios (stop-sign intersection with traffic vs. stop-sign intersection without traffic) were simulated using an advanced driving simulator. Behavioural variables (e.g. brake force, acceleration), visual variables (e.g. blink metrics, pupil size) and subjective workload scores were collected from 36 licensed Australian drivers. The experiment results showed that the HMI prompted drivers to apply a smooth and stable brake force when they approached the intersection and a smooth acceleration when they left the intersection. Drivers’ mental workload indicated by visual measurements were consistent with their subjective reported workload levels. Drivers had a higher mental workload when they received and processed additional eco-safe information in the advice \& feedback condition. An increase in mental workload induced by the in-vehicle cognitive task initiated more blink activities while the increase in visual demand caused by a complex road situation led to blink inhibition. The study shows the HMI could significantly promote eco-safe driving behaivours without causing excessive mental and visual workload of drivers.},

Thus, more microscopic and high-resolution traffic sensing data are needed. In addition, considering the random occurrence feature of crashes, high-risk events should be paid more attentions given their higher occurrence probability and consistent causations with crashes, which could proactively reduce crash likelihood. In this study, HighD Dataset from German highways was utilized for the empirical analyses. First, high-risk events were obtained using safety surrogate measures with Modified Time to Collision (MTTC) less than 2 s. Traffic operation characteristics within 5 s prior to event occurrence were extracted based on vehicle trajectory data. Then, a total of three different logistic regression models were established, which are standard logistic regression model, random-effects logistic regression (RELR) model, and random-parameter logistic regression (RPLR) model. Among which, the RPLR model was showed to have the best fitness and prediction accuracy. The results showed that the disturbed traffic flows in both longitudinal and lateral directions have positive impacts on high-risk events occurrence. Besides, too close following distance between vehicles would lead to high-risk events. Moreover, RPLR models could provide a high prediction accuracy of 97 \% for 2 s ahead of the high-risk events. Finally, potential safety improvement countermeasures and future application scenarios were also discussed.},

The videos have the same underlying traffic educational content but differ in the form of exhibition. We find that videos with shocking content (Australian school) are more effective in reducing drivers’ overconfidence, followed by those with punitive content (American school). We do not find empirical evidence that videos with technical content (European school) change overconfidence. Since several works point to a strong association between overconfidence and road safety, our study can support the conduit of driving safety measures by identifying efficient ways of reducing drivers’ overconfidence.

abstract = {We have investigated the accident’s statistics of Europe and North America that are provided by the UN. This investigation has shown that accidents due to the traffic represent around 50 \% of the total number of accidents every year. Among them, rear-end collisions hold a 20 \% share. These numbers display the fact that the interaction between drivers can be held responsible of those incidents. In this respect, we have explored the reasons behind the conflict situations that may be responsible of the occurrence of rear-end collisions by the mean of a cognitive psychology based cellular automata model. Indeed, through field experiments performed by an embedded camera, we have extricated a psychological cognitive process of anticipation. We have defined the latter as the tendency of drivers to accelerate based on the history of their predecessor. Then, we have exploited the tools of the physics of traffic by which we have developed a CA-model that take into consideration this process. As a result, we were able to generate those incidents’ situations. By considering two types of drivers: conservative who respect the learned information about the safe manoeuvres but make mistakes or aggressive who violate those secure processes, we have proved the complexity of the relationship between the states of the traffic flow and the drivers’ behaviours. In fact, we have shown that rear-end collisions are a result of the anticipation as a response of the drivers to the traffic conditions: the congestion. Moreover, we have also highlighted an improvement of the flow in the congested state up to 11 \% due to the anticipation, but that can only be achieved through vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Finally, we have investigated the hot spots. We have found that the traffic perturbations, that generate those hot spots and can be responsible of collisions, are more likely to be located away in the downstream direction. The distance between the two locations depends on the traffic density. This difference between the positions of the traffic perturbation and the hot spot has showcased the complexity, in time and space, of the transmission and the reception of deceleration information by the drivers.},

Fixed infrastructure-based vehicle detection devices were widely used in the previous studies to obtain different types of data for crash potential prediction. However, it was difficult to obtain data in large range through these devices due to the costs of installation and maintenance. This paper introduced a novel connected vehicle (CV) emulated data for real-time crash potential prediction. Different from the fixed devices’ data, CV emulated data have high flexibility and can be obtained continuously with relatively low cost. Crash and CV emulated data were collected from two urban arterials in Orlando, USA. Crash data were archived by the Signal for Analytics system (S4A), while the CV emulated data were obtained through the data collection API with a high frequency. Different data cleaning and preparation techniques were implemented, while various speed-related variables were generated from the CV emulated data. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network was trained to predict the crash potential in the next 5−10 min. The results from the model illustrated the feasibility of using a novel CV emulated data to predict real-time crash potential. The average and 50th percentile speed were the two most important variables for the crash potential prediction. In addition, the proposed LSTM outperformed Bayesian logistics regression and XGBoost in terms of sensitivity, Area under Curve (AUC), and false alarm rate. With the rapid development of the connected vehicle systems, the results from this paper can be extended to other types of vehicles and data, which can significantly enhance traffic safety.},

These systems pre-dominantly employ two components-sensors placed near the work zone perimeter that detect intrusions, and alarms placed closed to or carried by the workers that alerts them. This study investigates the association between layout of these components for three WZIAS on work zone crashes based on worker reaction. Also, the key determinants of work zone crashes in presence of the WZIAS is identified using survival analysis. The ideal deployment strategy and use case scenarios for the three WZIAS is presented based on the findings of the study. The systems were subjected to rigorous testing that emulated intrusions to record worker reaction and determine occurrence of crashes. Analysis of results indicate that the key determinants of work zone crashes are speed of the intruding vehicle, distance between the sensor and worker, and accuracy of a system in detecting intrusions and alerting workers. Results from field experiments suggest that identification of appropriate use cases for WZIAS is necessary to ensure they work effectively. Based on the findings from this study it is suggested that current guidelines on work zones be modified to standardize WZIAS setup.},

To solve the scarcity of incident samples, a novel incident detection framework is proposed based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). First, spatial and temporal rules are presented to extract variables from traffic data, which is followed by the random forest algorithm to rank the importance of variables. Then, some new incident samples are generated using GANs. Finally, the support vector machine algorithm is applied as the incident detection model. Real traffic data, which were collected from a 69.5-mile section of the I-80 highway, are used to validate the proposed approach. A total of 140 detectors are installed on the section enabling traffic flow to be measured every 30s. During 14 days, 139 incident samples and 946 nonincident samples were extracted from the raw data. Five categories of experiments are designed to evaluate whether the proposed framework can solve the small sample size problem, imbalanced sample problem, and timeliness problem in the current incident detection system. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can considerably improve the detection rate and reduce the false alarm rate of traffic incident detection. The balance of the dataset can improve the detection rate from 87.48\% to 90.68\% and reduce the false alarm rate from 12.76\% to 7.11\%. This paper lends support to further studies on combining GANs with the machine learning model to address the imbalance and small sample size problems related to intelligent transportation systems.},

These data have several noteworthy and significant shortcomings, including under-reporting, subjectivism, post hoc assessment of crash causes and contributing factors, limited behavioural information, and omitted potential important crash-related factors resulting in an omitted variable bias. Moreover, crashes are relatively rare events and require long observation periods to justify expenditures. The rarity of crashes leads to a moral dilemma—we must wait for sufficient crashes to accrue at a site—some involving injuries and even death—to then justify improvements to prevent crashes. The more quickly the profession can end its reliance on crashes to assess road safety, the better. Surrogate safety assessment methodologies, in contrast, are proactive in design, do not rely on crashes, and require shorter observation timeframes in which to formulate reliable safety assessments. Although surrogate safety assessment methodologies have been developed and assessed over the past 50 years, an overarching and unifying framework does not exist to date. A unifying framework will help to contextualize the role of various methodological developments and begin a productive discussion in the literature about how the various pieces do or should fit together to understand road user risk better. This paper aims to fill this gap by thoroughly mapping traffic conflicts and surrogate safety methodologies. A total of 549 studies were meticulously reviewed to achieve this aim of developing a unifying framework. The resulting framework provides a consolidated and up-to-date summary of surrogate safety assessment methodologies and conflict measures and metrics. Further work is needed to advance surrogate safety methodologies. Critical research needs to include identifying a comprehensive and reliable set of surrogate measures for risk assessment, establishing rigorous relationships between conflicts and crashes, developing ways to capture road user behaviours into surrogate-based safety assessment, and integrating crash severity measures into risk estimation.},

This paper reports on research that analyzed the real-time tire force data (kinetic response) obtained from vehicle kinetic experiments, and constructed a new approach for identifying the high-risk of crashes on freeway segments with horizontal curvature. First, the road was divided into 1km units. Then, taking into account the characteristics of freeway alignment, each segment with horizontal curve was selected as the object of subsequent analysis. Automotive instrumentation was used to obtain a measure of tire force in the course of normal driving. The entire data set was preprocessed according to rate of change and the density of the data was reduced. By defining the outliers of the kinetic data and conducting factor analysis, two representative crash risk indicators of longitudinal and lateral stability were obtained. Negative binomial regression model (NBR model) and random effects negative binomial regression model (RENBR model) were constructed and jointly applied based on the new indicators to predict the risk value of horizontal curve segments. The method showed good prediction performance (71.8 \%) for high-risk road segments with design flaws, but the predicted effect for low-risk road segments was not ideal. This study not only illustrated the effectiveness of in-vehicle data in assessing road crash risk by coupling multiple kinetic parameters, but also provided support for freeway safety research using surrogate measures of risk when there is a lack of crash statistics.},

In total, 21 studies were located that met inclusion criteria for the review. The range of sensitivity outcomes was between 39.0–98.8 \% and between 73.0–98.9 \% for specificity outcomes. There was considerable variation in the outcomes of the studies employing only one physiological measure (mono-signal approach), whereas, a poly-signal approach with multiple physiological signals resulted in more consistency with higher outcomes on both sensitivity and specificity metrics. Only six of the 21 studies had both sensitivity and specificity outcomes above 90.0 \%, which included mono- and poly-signal approaches. Moreover, increases in the number of features used in the sleepiness detection system did not result in higher sensitivity and specificity outcomes. Overall, there was considerable variability between the studies reviewed, including measures of ground truth, the features employed and the machine learning approach of the systems. A critical need for progressing any system is a revalidation of the system on a new sample of users. These aspects indicate considerable progress is needed with physiological-based driver sleepiness systems before they are at a sufficient standard to be deployed on-road.},

abstract = {The availability of large-scale naturalistic driving data provides enormous opportunities for studying relationships between instantaneous driving decisions prior to involvement in safety critical events (SCEs). This study investigates the role of driving instability prior to involvement in SCEs. While past research has studied crash types and their contributing factors, the role of pre-crash behavior in such events has not been explored as extensively. The research demonstrates how measures and analysis of driving volatility can be leading indicators of crashes and contribute to enhancing safety. Highly detailed microscopic data from naturalistic driving are used to provide the analytic framework to rigorously analyze the behavioral dimensions and driving instability that can lead to different types of SCEs such as roadway departures, rear end collisions, and sideswipes. Modeling results reveal a positive association between volatility and involvement in SCEs. Specifically, increases in both lateral and longitudinal volatilities represented by Bollinger bands and vehicular jerk lead to higher likelihoods of involvement in SCEs. Further, driver behavior related factors such as aggressive driving and lane changing also increases the likelihood of involvement in SCEs. Driver distraction, as represented by the duration of secondary tasks, also increases the risk of SCEs. Likewise, traffic flow parameters play a critical role in safety risk. The risk of involvement in SCEs decreases under free flow traffic conditions and increases under unstable traffic flow. Further, the model shows prediction accuracy of 88.1 \% and 85.7 \% for training and validation data. These results have implications for proactive safety and providing in-vehicle warnings and alerts to prevent the occurrence of such SCEs.},

Furthermore, the key burst papers that have played an important role in advancing research and guiding AA\&P in new directions – particularly those in the fields of crash frequency and crash-injury severity modeling analyses were identified.

By taking advantages of ‘Big Data’, this study proposes a data-driven method to develop a Copula-Bayesian Network (Copula-BN) using a large-scale naturalistic driving dataset with multiple features. The Copula-BN is able to explain the causality of a risky driving maneuver. As compared with conventional BNs, the Copula-BN developed in this study has the following advantages: the Copula-BN 1. Has a more rational and explainable structure; 2. Is less likely to be over-fitting and can attain more satisfactory prediction performance; and 3. Can handle not only discrete but also continuous features. In terms of technical innovations, Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) is used for feature selection, while Gaussian Copula function is employed to build the dependency structure of the Copula-BN. As for applications, the Copula-BNs are used to investigate the causality of risky lane-changing (LC) and car-following (CF) maneuvers, upon which the comparisons are made between the two essential but risky driving maneuvers. In this study, the Copula-BNs are developed based on the Second Highway Research Program (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) database. Upon network evaluation, the Copula-BNs for both risky LC and CF maneuvers demonstrate satisfactory structure performance and promising prediction performance. Feature inferences are conducted based on the Copula-BNs to respectively illustrate the causation of the two risky maneuvers. Several interesting findings related to features’ contribution are discussed in this paper. To a certain extent, the Copula-BN developed using the data-driven method makes a trade-off between prediction and causality within the ‘Big Data’. The comparison between risky LC and CF maneuvers also provides a valuable reference for crash risk evaluation, road safety policy-making, etc. In the future, the achievements of this study could be applied in Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) and accident diagnosis system to enhance road traffic safety.},

An LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) neural network is proposed to predict the pedestrian-vehicle conflicts 2 s ahead. The established model reaches an accuracy of 88.5 \% at one signalized intersection. It is further tested at a new intersection, reaching the accuracy of 84.9 \%, while the new data merely takes up 30 \% of the training data set. This indicates that the proposed model is promising to be implemented at different locations. Moreover, the proposed model can also be applied to develop collision warning systems under the Connected Vehicles’ environment.},

abstract = {A novel automatic incident detection (AID) method for freeways, based on the use of data provided by Bluetooth sensors and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach, is presented. The two main advantages of the proposed AID system are: (i) the use of Bluetooth sensors offers several practical advantages over inductive loop detectors (ILD), which is one of the preferred sensing technology for traffic flow; and (ii) the unsupervised anomaly detection approach builds a model without the need of incident information. A common problem when designing an AID system is that incident information, i.e., ground-truth data, with enough accuracy is seldom available. Isolation forest is the unsupervised anomaly detection approach adopted in this work. This method is based on characterizing anomalous traffic conditions by exploiting the fact that anomalies tend to be isolated. The most remarkable feature of this anomaly detection method is its high detection performance while having a very simple tuning procedure and an extremely low computational demand. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented AID method is demonstrated using real traffic data collected by a network of Bluetooth sensors installed in Ayalon Highway, Tel Aviv.},

annotation = {Primarily about sensors.  Not our data set.},
addendum = {It is also expected that other advanced methods like unsupervised
deep learning, see Chalapathy and Chawla (2019), Kwon et al. (2019),
may achieve the same or higher detection performance than the proposed
method. However, this is at the expense of using a more complex
model (large number of parameters) than the proposed in this work.
Finally, a caveat of the proposed AID method is that it is able to
identify anomalous traffic conditions, but it is not able to distinguish
the mechanism that generated these conditions, e.g., traffic accidents,
maintenance works, or anomalous traffic patterns. Future works could
explore the process of identification of anomalies and posterior classification
on data streams by applying novel techniques based on semisupervised
learning (Mu et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018b).

abstract = {Takeover performance in automated driving is subject to investigation in the context of a variety of driver states such as distraction or drowsiness. New driver states will emerge with increasing automation level with drivers potentially being allowed to sleep while driving a highly automated vehicle. Still at some point during a drive, drivers will be required to or voluntarily take back control of the vehicle. A simulator study was conducted to investigate drivers’ ability to take over the vehicle control after sleeping. In a within-subjects study design N = 25 test drivers completed a drive using a highly automated driving system a) during day time after a full night of sleep and b) early in the morning after a night of partial sleep deprivation. During the second drive, sleep was measured in drivers according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standard using electroencephalography (EEG). In total, the participants had to handle four takeover requests (TORs) from the system, two while being awake (day drive) and two when being awakened from sleep stage N2 (morning drive). The objective criticality of the situations was assessed performing the Takeover Controllability rating (TOC-rating). The results indicate that the applied takeover time of 60 s was sufficient for drivers to reengage in driving after sleeping. Reaction times were extended by about 3 s after sleep compared to the wake condition. Takeover performance assessed with the TOC-rating however was clearly worse after sleep than after wakefulness which was also reflected in the drivers’ subjective perception of the criticality of the situation. Further research is needed on how to deal with performance impairments after waking up from sleep during automated driving.},

This research investigated the use of SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data to assess infrastructure and other factors contributing to left turn crashes at signalized intersections, and how to improve older driver safety during such turns. NDS data for trips involving signalized intersections and crash or near-crash events were obtained for two driver age groups: drivers age 65 and over (older drivers) and a sample of drivers age 30−49, along with NDS pre-screening and questionnaire data. Video scoring of all trips was performed to collect additional information on intersection and trip conditions. To identify the most influential factors of crash risk during left turns at signalized intersections, machine learning and regression models were used. The results found that in the obtained NDS dataset, there was a relatively small volume of crashes during left turns at signalized intersections. Further, model results found the statistically significant variables of crash risk for older drivers were associated more with health and cognitive factors rather than the infrastructure or design of the intersections. The results suggest that a study using only SHRP2 NDS data will not lead to definitive findings or recommendations for infrastructure changes to increase safety for older drivers at signalized intersections and during left turns. Moreover, the findings of this study indicates the need to consider other data sources and data collection methods to address this critical literature gap in older driver safety.},

These sensor data are combined with traffic and road geometry characteristics and subsequently depicted spatially using Geographical Information System software. Events of harsh driver behavior (8592 harsh accelerations and 3946 harsh brakings) were mapped to delimited segments and junctions of two urban expressways in Athens, Greece. For the analysis, two multiple linear regression models and two log-linear regression models were developed. Results indicate that in road segments there is an increase in the number of harsh events if average traffic flow per lane increases in the respective areas. Furthermore, as the average occupancy increases in junctions, there is an increase in harsh accelerations, and as the average speed increases, more harsh deceleration events occur. It is evident that traffic characteristics (traffic flow \& speed) have the most statistically significant impact on the frequency of harsh events compared to factors related to road geometry and driver behavior.},

annotation = {Not ML, Smartphone Data},
addendum = {The results of this study may be transferred to similar areas outside
the research area. However, prior to any generalization, necessary adjustments
should be made for possible variations in the road environment
and traffic. For instance, an analogous study should be conducted
for motorways or rural roads that have fundamentally different characteristics
than urban expressways in order to obtain more accurate
results for these road environments. Alternative count models such as
GLMs with known merits for similar research or machine learning
methods should also be investigated. Initial Poisson loglinear model
applications have shown that the discovered relationships are retained
in significance and sign (positive or negative influences). Intuitively,
several crash frequency methods found in the rich road safety literature
have the potential to be applied in harsh event investigation, and the
respective findings will augment and expand the knowledge obtained
from strictly analyzing crashes.
Furthermore, a very promising direction for future research would
be the investigation of crash numbers and locations in the same research
areas. It would be fruitful to test correlations of crash frequencies
with some of the variables that have been identified in the
present study, and to explore any correlations between harsh event
frequencies and crash frequencies as well. However, it is worth noting
that this endeavor requires significant updates in crash data collection
procedures in Greece, as crash locations tend to be very imprecise
compared to high-resolution smartphone data. A similar conundrum
rises when weather data are brought into consideration. The inclusion
of weather data in the present context would be quite interesting, as
there can be considered to be related to crashes from research
(Theofilatos and Yannis, 2014), and to harsh events from observation
and experience. However, the high resolution smartphone data utilized
in the study would be best paired with comparably high resolution
weather data, which are at present not readily available. Therefore,
further research is needed to create a proper smartphone naturalistic
driving data and weather data merging scheme, which will yield usable
results towards this direction.}

abstract = {With the development of technology in the world, vehicles that reach high speeds are produced. In addition, with the increase of road width and quality, faster and more comfortable transportation can be provided. These developments also increase the speed violation rates of road vehicles. Drivers who violate speed limits can endanger both their own lives and the lives of others. Speed violations, of especially heavy vehicles, involve much greater risks than that of light vehicles. Heavy vehicles can cause more serious losses of lives and property in accidents, compared to the ones caused by light vehicles, as they can carry much more freight or passengers than light vehicles. In this study, data regarding the speed violations committed by heavy vehicles in Turkey, were used. Speed violations were divided into 10 classes according to the intensity of speed violation rates. After this process, all provinces were classified according to support vector machines (SVM), naive bayes (NB) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms. When the accuracy values and error scales of all three algorithms are examined, it has been determined that the algorithm that gives the most accurate results is the NB algorithm. Based on the classification of this algorithm, speed violation density maps of types of heavy vehicles in Turkey were created by using spatial analysis. According to the density maps, the provinces with the highest speed violations were identified. In the results, it was determined that the rate of heavy vehicle speed violation was highest in the cities such as Erzurum, Konya, and Muğla. Later, these cities were examined in terms of heavy vehicle mobility. At the end of this study, measures were proposed to reduce these violations in cities where speeding violations are intense. Material and moral damages can be prevented, to a great extent, with the implementation of recommendations of policymakers which can reduce speed violations.},

To this end, we comparatively apply three data balance methods, i.e., the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), the Borderline SMOTE (BL-SMOTE), and the Majority Weighted Minority Oversampling (MWMOTE). Then, we examine different Bayesian networks (BNs) to explore the contributing factors of fatal injury crashes. The 2016 highway crash data of Ghana are retrieved for the case study. The results show that the accuracy of the injury severity classification is improved by using the preprocessed data. Highest improvement is observed on the data preprocessed by the MWMOTE technique. Statistical verification is done by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The inference results of the best BNs show the significant factors of fatal crashes which include off-peak time, non-intersection area, pedestrian involved collisions, rural road environment, good tarred road, roads without shoulders, and multiple vehicles involved crash.},

Trends reveal that derailments consistently account for more than 70 \% of the U.S. railroad industry’s average annual accident cost. Hence, knowledge of explanatory factors that distinguish derailments from other accident types can inform more cost-effective and impactful railroad risk management strategies. Five feature scoring methods, including ANOVA and Gini, agreed that the top four explanatory factors in accident type prediction were track class, type of movement authority, excess speed, and territory signalization. Among 11 different types of machine learning algorithms, the extreme gradient boosting method was most effective at predicting the accident type with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) metric of 89 \%. Principle component analysis revealed that relative to other accident types, derailments were more strongly associated with lower track classes, non-signalized territories, and movement authorizations within restricted limits. On average, derailments occurred at 16 kph below the speed limit for the track class whereas other accident types occurred at 32 kph below the speed limit. Railroads can use the integrated data preparation, machine learning, and feature ranking framework presented to gain additional insights for managing risk, based on their unique operating environments.},

The accurate real-time crash risk prediction is fundamental to the system running well. Crash data are characterized by small probability, which poses a typical Imbalanced Data Classification problem. Most previous studies mainly improved the prediction methods only in data level or algorithm level, which may be inadequate to predict the crash risk accurately especially in a continuous real-time traffic data environment. The comprehensive imbalanced classification algorithm was examined in this research to build more accurate real-time traffic crash risk prediction model. At the output level, the Youden index method has been proved to be of the best ability to divide the prediction results and Probability Calibration Method was proposed to optimize the prediction results in further. At the data level, Under-sampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE) methods were compared to solve the imbalanced data classification problem by changing the data distribution. At the algorithm level, the cost-sensitive MLP algorithm and Adaboost algorithm were examined and finally the random sampling cost-sensitive MLP model(RCSMLP) and Rusboost model were constructed by synthesizing the optimization methods from three levels. The sensitivity of the RCSMLP model reached 78.10 \% and the specificity of the model reached 81.44 \%. The AUC and sensitivity of the Rusboost model reached 0.892 and 0.842 while the specificity of the model reached 0.816, which shows the better performance in dealing with the imbalanced traffic crash risk prediction problem compared to existed prediction models. The proposed method of improving prediction accuracy in this study is universal and can be applied to many other prediction models to predict real-time traffic crash risk.},

abstract = {Highway work zones are most vulnerable roadway segments for congestion and traffic collisions. Hence, providing accurate and timely prediction of the severity of traffic collisions at work zones is vital to reduce the response time for emergency units (e.g., medical aid), accordingly improve traffic safety and reduce congestion. In predicting the severity of traffic collisions, previous studies used different statistical and machine learning models with accuracy as the main evaluating factor. However, the performance of these models was generally not good, especially on fatal and injury crashes. Also, looking into the prediction accuracy only is misleading. This paper aims to propose a novel deep learning-based approach with a customized f1-loss function to predict the severity of traffic crashes. Underlying this objective is to compare the results of deep learning models with machine learning model considering two performance indicators, namely precision, and recall. The data used in the analysis include a sample of traffic crashes that occurred at work zones in Louisiana from 2014 to 2018. This dataset includes valuable information (features) related to road, vehicle, and human factors affecting the occurrence and severity of those crashes. The proposed methodology is based on transforming these features/variables into images. Image transformation is conducted using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE and convex hull algorithm. A CNN based deep learning algorithm with a customized loss function was used to directly optimize the model for precision and recall. The results showed improved performance in predicting the crash severity of fatal and injury crashes using the deep learning approach, which can help to improve traffic safety as well as traffic congestion at work zones and possibly other roadways segments.},

abstract = {Road crashes have become a leading cause of death in China. Although enormous efforts have been exerted to determine the factors that affect individual crash incidents, neighborhood-level crash incidence in Chinese cities has not been sufficiently analyzed. This study fills this gap by quantifying the effects of built environment factors on neighborhood-level automobile-involved crash density (NACD) in urban China and identifying its mediators and mediating effects. In American suburbs, urban sprawl is widely recognized to render neighborhoods unsafe for residence, thus leading to a high crash incidence. This study compares the characteristics of built environments between inner-city neighborhoods and the new neighborhoods that have been developed through China’s state-led suburbanization since 2008 to reveal how this suburbanization provides a safer neighborhood environment. A structural equation model is used to examine the relationships among suburbanization, built environment factors, and NACD in the city proper of Chengdu, the largest metropolis in southwest China. Thus, this study contributes new empirical evidence to the debates over urban designs that are safest for traffic. Moreover, this study enriches our understanding of different sociospatial consequences between American-style urban sprawl and China’s state-led suburbanization.},

abstract = {The identification of accident hot spots is a central task of road safety management. Bayesian count data models have emerged as the workhorse method for producing probabilistic rankings of hazardous sites in road networks. Typically, these methods assume simple linear link function specifications, which, however, limit the predictive power of a model. Furthermore, extensive specification searches are precluded by complex model structures arising from the need to account for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial correlations. Modern machine learning (ML) methods offer ways to automate the specification of the link function. However, these methods do not capture estimation uncertainty, and it is also difficult to incorporate spatial correlations. In light of these gaps in the literature, this paper proposes a new spatial negative binomial model which uses Bayesian additive regression trees to endogenously select the specification of the link function. Posterior inference in the proposed model is made feasible with the help of the Pólya-Gamma data augmentation technique. We test the performance of this new model on a crash count data set from a metropolitan highway network. The empirical results show that the proposed model performs at least as well as a baseline spatial count data model with random parameters in terms of goodness of fit and site ranking ability.},

abstract = {In SAE Level 3 automated driving, taking over control from automation raises significant safety concerns because drivers out of the vehicle control loop have difficulty negotiating takeover transitions. Existing studies on takeover transitions have focused on drivers’ behavioral responses to takeover requests (TORs). As a complement, this exploratory study aimed to examine drivers’ psychophysiological responses to TORs as a result of varying non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), traffic density and TOR lead time. A total number of 102 drivers were recruited and each of them experienced 8 takeover events in a high fidelity fixed-base driving simulator. Drivers’ gaze behaviors, heart rate (HR) activities, galvanic skin responses (GSRs), and facial expressions were recorded and analyzed during two stages. First, during the automated driving stage, we found that drivers had lower heart rate variability, narrower horizontal gaze dispersion, and shorter eyes-on-road time when they had a high level of cognitive load relative to a low level of cognitive load. Second, during the takeover transition stage, 4 s lead time led to inhibited blink numbers and larger maximum and mean GSR phasic activation compared to 7 s lead time, whilst heavy traffic density resulted in increased HR acceleration patterns than light traffic density. Our results showed that psychophysiological measures can indicate specific internal states of drivers, including their workload, emotions, attention, and situation awareness in a continuous, non-invasive and real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using psychophysiological measures in automated driving and for future applications in driver monitoring systems and adaptive alert systems.},

MARS is a non-black-box model and can effectively handle non-linear crash predictors and interactions. A total of 1,311 bicycle-vehicle crashes from 2011 through 2015 in Alabama were collected and their respective police reports were reviewed in details. Results from the SPFs for roadway segments using COM-Poisson showed that bicycle-vehicle crash frequencies were reduced along curved and downgrade/upgrade stretches and when having heavy traffic flow (along U2U segments). For urban signalized (USG) intersections, the absence of right-turn lanes on minor roads, the presence of bus stops, and the increase in the major road annual average daily traffic (AADT) were significant factors contributing to the increase in the number of bicycle-vehicle crashes. However, the presence of divided medians on major approaches was found to reduce bicycle-vehicle crashes at USG and UST intersections. MARS outperformed the corresponding COM-Poisson models for all five facilities based on mean absolute deviance (MAD), mean square prediction error (MSPE), and generalized R-square.

abstract = {Road crashes impose an important burden on health and the economy. Numerous efforts have been undertaken to understand the factors that affect road collisions in general, and the severity of crashes in particular. In this literature several strategies have been proposed to model interactions between parties in a crash, including the use of variables regarding the other party (or parties) in the collision, data subsetting, and estimating models with hierarchical components. Since no systematic assessment has been conducted of the performance of these strategies, they appear to be used in an ad-hoc fashion in the literature. The objective of this paper is to empirically evaluate ways to model party interactions in the context of crashes involving two parties. To this end, a series of models are estimated using data from Canada's National Collision Database. Three levels of crash severity (no injury/injury/fatality) are analyzed using ordered probit models and covariates for the parties in the crash and the conditions of the crash. The models are assessed using predicted shares and classes of outcomes, and the results highlight the importance of considering opponent effects in crash severity analysis. The study also suggests that hierarchical (i.e., multi-level) specifications and subsetting do not necessarily perform better than a relatively simple single-level model with opponent-related factors. The results of this study provide insights regarding the performance of different modelling strategies, and should be informative to researchers in the field of crash severity.},

annotation = {Interesting for solid paper.},
addendum = {The analysis also opens up a few avenues for future research. First,
for reasons discussed in Section 6, we did not consider more sophisticated
modelling approaches, such as models with random components,
partial proportional odds, ranked ordered models, or multinomial
models, to mention just a few possibilities. Secondly, we only considered
the performance of the models when making predictions for the
full sample. That is, the submodels in the ensembles were not compared
in detail, just their aggregate results when predicting the full sample.
However, the goodness-of-fit was not uniformly better for any one
modelling strategy when the data were subset, and it is possible that
individual models perform better for a certain subset than competitors
that are part of a better ensemble, overall. For this reason, we suggest
that additional work with ensemble approaches is warranted. Finally, it
is clear that the models do not generally do well when predicting the
least frequent class of outcome, namely Fatality. It would be worthwhile
to further investigate approaches for so-called imbalanced
learning, a task that has received attention in the machine learning
community (e.g., Haixiang et al., 2017; He and Garcia, 2009), and

Three driving simulator experiment scenarios were developed to simulate the typical traffic and weather conditions on the rural Interstate 80 (I-80) in Wyoming. A total of 25 professional drivers from the WYDOT and trucking industry were recruited to participate in the driving simulator experiment. Participants’ instantaneous speeds at various locations were collected to reveal the effects of CV TIMs on their speed selection. The results showed that average speed profiles under CV scenarios were generally lower than under baseline scenarios, particularly for winter conditions (snowy and severe weather). The variance of speed under CV scenarios was found to be significantly lower than the baseline scenarios, indicating that CV TIMs have the potential to harmonize the variations in speed. In addition, for the work zone driving simulator experiment, this research revealed that the mean time-to-collision (TTC) under baseline scenario is approximately 40 \% lower than CV scenario, and the mean deceleration to avoid a crash (DRAC) under baseline scenario is approximately 19.3 \% higher than CV scenario. These findings suggest that CV TIMs can reduce the risk of crashes. Research findings would provide the WYDOT with early insights into the effectiveness of CV TIMs, which could assist with developing more efficient transportation management strategies under adverse weather conditions.},

Participants completed 12 lane-changing manoeuvres in three drives, categorised by degree of manual engagement with the driving task: Fully Manual Drive, Manual Intervention Required, Fully Automated Drive (Manual drive, Partial automation, Full automation). For Partial automation, drivers resumed control from the automated system and changed lane manually. For Full automation, the automated system managed the lane change, but participants initiated the manoeuvre by pulling the indicator lever. Results were compared to the Manual drive condition, where drivers controlled the vehicle at all times. For each driving condition, lane changing was initiated by drivers, at their discretion, in response to a slow-moving lead vehicle, which entered their lane. Failure to change lane did not result in a collision. To understand how different motor control requirements affected driver visual attention, eye movements to the road centre, and drivers' vertical and horizontal gaze dispersion were compared during different stages of the lane change manoeuvre, for the three drives. Results showed that drivers' attention to the road centre was generally lower for drives with less motor control requirements, especially when they were not engaged in the lane change process. However, as drivers moved closer to the lead vehicle, and prepared to change lane, the pattern of eye movements to the road centre converged, regardless of whether drivers were responsible for the manual control of the lane change. While there were no significant differences in horizontal gaze dispersion between the three drives, vertical dispersion for the two levels of automation was quite different, with higher dispersion during Partial automation, which was due to a higher reliance on the HMI placed in the centre console.},

Many previous studies on driving strategies mainly focused on the low-level detailed driving behaviors or specific traffic scenarios but lacked the high-level driving strategy studies. Though researchers showed increasing interest in driving strategies, there still has no comprehensive answer on how to proactively implement safe driving. After analyzing several representative driving strategies, we propose three characteristic dimensions that are important to measure driving strategies: preferred objective, risk appetite, and collaborative manner. According to these three characteristic dimensions, we categorize existing driving strategies of autonomous vehicles into four kinds: defensive driving strategies, competitive driving strategies, negotiated driving strategies, and cooperative driving strategies. This paper provides a timely comparative review of these four strategies and highlights the possible directions for improving the high-level driving strategy design.},
institution = {Tsinghua U},
annotation = {Not ML},
addendum = {We believe that future research should focus on the following valuable
directions:
1) Limited by the level of hardware and algorithm, there is still much
room for improvement in the accuracy and range of the current
perception system. Therefore, as the latter segment of perception, the
driving strategies of AVs need to be designed specifically based on
some limitations and assumptions of perception, and hence cannot
solve all problems in a generic way.
2) The current driving strategies are based on an indispensable
assumption of using identical technical equipment and the same
control strategy for all vehicles (Geiger et al., 2012). However, due to
the inconsistency of interpretation models and preferred objectives,
different AVs may have different understandings and responses to
the same scenarios. When they lack necessary communication or
communication channels are disturbed, their misunderstandings and
misjudgments will become a new trigger to danger. Therefore, how
to formulate a framework to ensure that AVs with different driving
strategies still can reach consensus is an urgent issue for future
researchers.
3) So far, research on risk appetite, the feature closely related to safety,
is still insufficient and deserves further advancement. Especially,
how should the risk appetite of different strategies be tested, evaluated,
and quantified. In consideration of the long-tail problem, how
to design simulation tests to reflect the risk appetite of the strategies
accurately (Li et al., 2016, 2018a; Li et al., 2019a,b).
4) Future research should focus more on communication and collaboration
between vehicles. For collaboration with other AVs, the unification
of communication rules and protocols should be accelerated,
to form a standardized and extensible inter-vehicle communication
mechanism.
5) For collaboration with human-driven vehicles, we should further
construct human driver models from the cognitive level rather than
the behaviors itself (Efrati, 2018; Stewart, 2018; Ma et al., 2010;
Schwarting et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018b; Michon, 1985). It can help
massively to develop a more reasonable collaborative driving strategy
and improve the probability of understanding each other
correctly when AVs interact with human-driven vehicles.
6) In the next step, researchers should pay more attention to TPACC and
explore the possibility of combining it with collaborative driving. It
is a meaningful work to accurately compare the individual benefits
and the overall benefits through theoretical calculations or simulation
tests.
7) The purpose of this paper is to draw attention of researchers towards
these important directions. We expect more exciting results will be
obtained soon.}

Modern instrumentation and computational resources allow for the monitorization of driver, vehicle, and roadway/environment to extract leading indicators of crashes from multi-dimensional data streams. To quantify variations that are beyond normal in driver behavior and vehicle kinematics, the concept of volatility is applied. The study measures driver-vehicle volatilities using the naturalistic driving data. By integrating and fusing multiple real-time streams of data, i.e., driver distraction, vehicular movements and kinematics, and instability in driving, this study aims to predict occurrence of safety critical events and generate appropriate feedback to drivers and surrounding vehicles. The naturalistic driving data is used which contains 7566 normal driving events, and 1315 severe events (i.e., crash and near-crash), vehicle kinematics, and driver behavior collected from more than 3500 drivers. In order to capture the local dependency and volatility in time-series data 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and 1DCNN-LSTM are applied. Vehicle kinematics, driving volatility, and impaired driving (in terms of distraction) are used as the input parameters. The results reveal that the 1DCNN-LSTM model provides the best performance, with 95.45\% accuracy and prediction of 73.4\% of crashes with a precision of 95.67\%. Additional features are extracted with the CNN layers and temporal dependency between observations is addressed, which helps the network learn driving patterns and volatile behavior.

abstract = {Accurate detection of traffic accidents as well as condition analysis are essential to effectively restoring traffic flow and reducing serious injuries and fatalities. This goal can be obtained using an advanced data classification model with a rich source of traffic information. Several systems based on sensors and social networking platforms have been presented recently to detect traffic events and monitor traffic conditions. However, sensor-based systems provide limited information, and may fail owing to the long detection times and high false-alarm rates. In addition, social networking data are unstructured, unpredictable, and contain idioms, jargon, and dynamic topics. The machine learning algorithms utilized for traffic event detection might not extract valuable information from social networking data. In this paper, a social network–based, real-time monitoring framework is proposed for traffic accident detection and condition analysis using ontology and latent Dirichlet allocation (OLDA) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). First, the query-based search engine effectively collects traffic information from social networks, and the data preprocessing module transforms it into structured form. Second, the proposed OLDA-based topic modeling method automatically labels each sentence (e.g., traffic or non-traffic) to identify the exact traffic information. In addition, the ontology-based event recognition approach detects traffic events from traffic-related data. Next, the sentiment analysis technique identifies the polarity of traffic events employing user’s opinions, which helps determine accurate conditions of traffic events. Finally, the FastText model and Bi-LSTM with softmax regression are trained for traffic event detection and condition analysis. The proposed framework is evaluated using traffic-related data, comparing OLDA and Bi-LSTM with existing topic modeling methods and traditional classifiers using word embedding models, respectively. Our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves accuracy of 97 \%. This finding demonstrates that the proposed system is more efficient for traffic event detection and condition analysis, in comparison to other existing systems.},

that could influence the crash severity. However, the only speed estimates
available are those provided on the police report, which are either
estimated by the drivers involved or the responding officer after
the crash. Given the potential inaccuracies in this data, speed estimates

could provide useful insights into the impact of this variable on crash
severity prior to involvement in a crash event.}

Based on the Structural Equation Model (SEM), this study involves a sample of 3150 drivers from the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP 2), to explore the relationships among drivers’ demographic characteristics (gender, age, and cumulative driving years), sensation seeking, risk perception, and risky driving behaviors. More specifically, the mediation model of driver characteristics on risky driving behaviors moderated by gender is constructed by the SEM. The results show that the effects of driving experience on risky driving behaviors are partially mediated by sensation seeking and risk perception for male drivers, while those are completely mediated by sensation seeking and risk perception for female drivers. Moreover, the development trend of risky driving behavior engagements declines greater with the growing of driving experience for female drivers than male drivers. Finally, a classification model of the driver’s driving risk is proposed by the Random Forest classifier, in which the driving risk level of the driver evaluated by the crash and near-crash rate could be classified through the driver’s self-reported demographics, sensation seeking, risk perception, and risky driving behaviors. The classification accuracy achieves up to 90 percent, which offers an alternative approach to identifying potential high-risk drivers to reduce property losses, injuries, and death caused by traffic accidents.},

The study aims to evaluate two main research topics. The first one is investigation of the effect of road infrastructure, road geometry, street, accident, atmospheric and cyclist related parameters on the classification of cyclist injury-severity similarly to other studies in the literature. The second one is examination of the performance of the new fuzzy decision approaches described in detail in this study for the classification of cyclist injury-severity. For this purpose, the data set containing bicycle-vehicle accidents in 2013–2017 was analyzed with the classic C4.5 algorithm and two different hybrid fuzzy decision mechanisms, namely DT-based converted FL (DT-CFL) and novel DT-based revised FL (DT-RFL). The model performances were compared according to their accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure values. The results indicated that the parameters that have the greatest effect on the injury-severity in bicycle-vehicle accidents are gender, vehicle damage-extent, road-type as well as the highly effective parameters such as pavement type, accident type, and vehicle-movement. The most successful classification performance among the three models was achieved by the DT-RFL model with 72.0 \% F-measure and 69.96 \% Accuracy. With 59.22 \% accuracy and \%57.5 F-measure values, the DT-CFL model, rules of which were created according to the splitting criteria of C4.5 algorithm, gave worse results in the classification of the injury-severity in bicycle-vehicle accidents than the classical C4.5 algorithm. In light of these results, the use of fuzzy decision mechanism models presented in this study on more comprehensive datasets is recommended for further studies.},

At present, these systems are able to control some portions of the driving task (e.g., braking, steering) for extended time periods, giving drivers the opportunity to disengage from the responsibilities associated with driving. In this study, data derived from two naturalistic driving studies involving automation-equipped vehicles were analyzed to evaluate driver behaviors with respect to driving automation system use, specifically distraction-related factors (i.e., secondary task engagement, eye-glance behavior, and drowsiness). The results indicate that when drivers had prior experience using driving automation systems, they were almost two times as likely to participate in distracted driving behaviors when the systems were active than during manual driving. Drivers with less experience and familiarity with driving automation systems were less likely to drive distracted when the systems were active; however, these drivers tended to be somewhat drowsy when driving with systems activated. The results provide important insights into different operational phases of driving automation system use (i.e., learning/unfamiliar vs experienced users), whereby experience results in overtrust and overreliance on the advanced technologies, which subsequently may negate some of the safety benefits of these systems.

Drivers in the VCC NDS had an app on their smart phone that provided
safety-related driving information, such as weather, traffic, and
driving conditions. The data reduction process did not (and could not)
distinguish between study-related app use and personal phone use.
Thus, the eye glance analyses focused on eyes-off-road glances rather
than non-driving-related task glances.
While NDSs allow the objective observation of driver performance
and behavior, the nature of such studies precludes the use of intrusive
instrumentation. As such, cognitive distraction could only be inferred
from the study data and not directly measured. Refining the process of
machine learning would be beneficial for future studies. For example,
dash layout and automation icon appearance and location are vital to
the machine-learning process; thus, vehicles with status icons that are
not easy to distinguish were excluded from the current study. Finally,
NDSs are dependent upon volunteer drivers. As such, a self-selection

abstract = {Objective
The paper presents a systematic analysis of drivers’ crash avoidance response during crashes and near-crashes and developed a machine learning-based predictive model that can determine driver maneuver using pre-incident driver behavior and driving context.
Methods
We analyzed 286 naturalistic rear-end crashes and near-crashes from the SHRP2 naturalistic driving study. All the events were manually reduced using face video (face and forward) and kinematic responses. In this paper, we developed new reduction variables that enhanced the understanding of drivers’ gaze behavior and roadway attention behavior during these events. These features reflected how the event criticality, measured using time to collision, related to drivers’ pre-incident behavior (secondary behavior, gaze behavior), and drivers’ perception of the event (physical reaction and maneuver). The imperative understanding of such relations was validated using a random forest- (RF) based classifier, which efficiently predicted if a driver was going to brake or change the lane as an avoidance maneuver.
Results
The RF presented in this paper effectively explored the nonlinear patterns in the data and was highly accurate (∼96 \%) in its prediction. A further analysis of the RF model showed that six features played a pivotal role in the decision logic. These included the drivers’ last glance duration before the event, last glance eccentricity, duration of ‘eyes on road’ immediately before the event, the time instance and criticality when the driver perceives the threat as well as acknowledge the threat, and possibility of an escape path in the adjacent lane. Using partial dependency plots, we also showed how different thresholds of these feature variables determined the drivers’ maneuver intention.
Conclusions
In this paper we analyzed driving context, drivers’ behavior, event criticality, and drivers’ response in a unified structure to predict their avoidance response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such effort where large-scale naturalistic data (crashes and near crashes) was analyzed for prediction of drivers’ maneuver and determined key behavioral and contextual factors that contribute to this avoidance maneuver.},

This study is designed to identify the AV safety quantification studies, evaluate the quantification approaches used in the literature, and uncover the gaps and challenges in AV safety evaluation. We employed a scoping review methodology to identify the approaches used in the literature to quantify AV safety. After screening and reviewing the literature, six approaches were identified: target crash population, traffic simulation, driving simulator, road test data analysis, system failure risk assessment, and safety effectiveness estimation. We ran two evaluations on the identified approaches. First, we investigated each approach in terms of its input (required data, assumptions, etc.), output (safety evaluation metrics), and application (to estimate AVs' safety implications at the vehicle, transportation system, and society levels). Second, we qualitatively compared them in terms of three criteria: availability of input data, suitability for evaluating different automation levels, and reliability of estimations. This review identifies four challenges in AV safety evaluation: (a) shortcomings in AV safety evaluation approaches, (b) uncertainties in AV implementations and their impacts on AV safety, (c) potential riskier behavior of AV passengers as well as other road users, and (d) emerging safety issues related to AV implementations. This review is expected to help researchers and rulemakers to choose the most appropriate quantification method based on their goals and study limitations.

After detecting the pre-events, an alarm will be automatically generated in the control room which helps to take precautionary measures to avoid any potential mishap on road, thereby, improving the road safety. In previous studies, a single system can handle either one or two pre-events. Whereas, in our present study, five anomalies can be detected in a single system using five different algorithms. Our study further contributes to the detection of “wrong drop-off location of passengers”. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms is demonstrated over 132 traffic videos acquired from an integrated plant in India. Some additional comparative studies for overtaking and illegal parking are done using two benchmark datasets, namely ‘CamSeq01’ and ‘ISLab-PVD’.

This study uses real-time event-based detection records, and crash data to develop predictive models for the vehicle occupants' injury severity. The three-year (2017–2019) data were acquired from the arterial highways in the City of Tallahassee, Florida. Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers were used to identify the important factors on the vehicle occupants' injury severity prediction. The performance comparison of the two classifiers revealed that the XGBoost has a higher balanced accuracy score than RF. Using the XGBoost classifier, five topmost influential factors on injury prediction were identified. The factors are the manner of the collision, through and right-turn traffic volume, arrival on red for through and right-turn traffic, split failure for through traffic, and delays for through and right-turn traffic. Moreover, the partial dependency plots of the influential variables are presented to reveal their impact on vehicle occupant injury prediction.

it was not possible to derive this parameter from the detector data. Thus,
future research can investigate the role of approaching real-time speed
together with other risk factors on the occupant injury. It will be an
opportunity for future work to investigate the impact of time intervals
such as 2, 5, and 15 min in the real-time safety analysis. Also, the current
study investigated the influence of a downstream traffic signal only on
the occupant injury. The analysis did not consider the effects of the
upstream intersection. Further study can incorporate the nearby upstream
intersection as well in the analysis.
Several classification metrics are known to address the issue of
imbalanced data. The current study only adopted the balanced accuracy
metric. It will be an opportunity for future work to evaluate other
metrics such as F-score, class-weighted evaluation metrics in the analysis
of an imbalanced dataset.
It merits referencing that the underreporting of crashes, particularly
for least severe crashes is one of the attributes that may bias the results of
models developed using historical crash data. Future work may consider
variables that relate to vehicle occupants including seating position and
occupant status. Besides, pedestrian compliance particularly at signalized
intersections is normally impacted by the prevailing traffic and
signal characteristics. Thus, it will be an opportunity for future research
to investigate factors affecting pedestrian compliance at signalized intersections

Drivers’ physiological data included heart rate indices, galvanic skin response indices, and eye-tracking metrics. Driving environment data included scenario type, traffic density, and TOR lead time. Drivers’ takeover performance was categorized as good or bad according to their driving behaviors during the transition period and was treated as the ground truth. Using six machine learning methods, we found that the random forest classifier performed the best and was able to predict drivers’ takeover performance when they were engaged in NDRTs with different levels of cognitive load. We recommended 3 s as the optimal time window to predict takeover performance using the random forest classifier, with an accuracy of 84.3\% and an F1-score of 64.0\%.

Understanding the associations between trip/driving/roadways features and speeding behavior is crucial for both researchers and practitioners. This research utilized naturalistic driving data collected by the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) program and roadway features from a road inventory dataset - Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS), provided by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), to investigate the hidden rules that associated trip/driving/roadway features with speeding behavior. A classification-based association (CBA) algorithm was adopted to explore the hidden rules from two perspectives of speeding: speeding duration and speeding pattern. Results indicate that the combinations of longer trips (more than 60 min), driving on the roadways with a relatively higher functional class are highly associated with longer speeding events (speeding longer than 2 min). The moderate speeding events (speeding longer than 2 min and longer than 30 s) are found highly associated with the combination of driving on roadways with lower functional class, absence of a median and relatively short trip time (less than 30 min). The research also found the combinations of driving on roadways with relatively lower functional class, experienced congestion before a speeding event, and the presence of a median is a leading cause that triggers a higher speeding pattern (speeding more than 5mph above the speed limit). Furthermore, the moderate speeding pattern (speeding more than 1mph above the speed limit and less than 5mph of the speed limit) is associated with the combinations of factors like experiencing congestion before a speed event, driving on roadways with higher functional class and a relatively shorter trip (less than 30 min). The findings can help practitioners understand the composite effect of these factors more comprehensively and provide corresponding countermeasures to mitigate the negative consequences of speeding wherever possible. These can also help in calibrating driver behavior parameters for transportation-related simulation tools.},

The increasingly abundant crowdsourcing data and floating car data provide new support for improving traffic accident management. This paper investigates the methods to predict the complicated behavior of traffic flow evolution after traffic accidents using crowdsourcing data. Based on the available data source, the traffic condition is divided into four levels by congestion delay index: severely congested, congested, slow moving and uncongested. Four types of accidents are consequently defined based on the occurrence of each level. A hierarchical scheme is designed for identifying the most congested level and sequentially predicting duration of each level. The proposed model is validated using traffic accident data in 2017 from an anonymous source in Beijing, China by embedding three machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN), in the scheme. The results show NN outperforms the other two models when the assessment is conducted in absolute differences. Meanwhile, RF has a slightly better performance than SVM, especially when predicting the short-period congestion of severely congested level at the first time. By continuously updating the traffic condition information, significant improvement in accuracy can be acquired regardless of the exact model used. This study shows that emerging crowdsourcing data can be used in a real-time analysis of traffic accidents and the proposed model is effective to analyze such data.},

abstract = {Lane change has been recognized as a challenging driving maneuver and a significant component of traffic safety research. Developing a real-time continuous lane change detection system can assist drivers to perform and deal with complex driving tasks or provide assistance when it is needed the most. This study proposed trajectory-level lane change detection models based on features from vehicle kinematics, machine vision, roadway characteristics, and driver demographics under different weather conditions. To develop the models, the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) and Roadway Information Database (RID) datasets were utilized. Initially, descriptive statistics were utilized to investigate the lane change behavior, which revealed significant differences among different weather conditions for most of the parameters. Six data fusion categories were introduced for the first time, considering different data availability. In order to select relevant features in each category, Boruta, a wrapper-based algorithm was employed. The lane change detection models were trained, validated, and comparatively evaluated using four Machine Learning algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and eXtrem Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results revealed that the highest overall detection accuracy was found to be 95.9 \% using the XGBoost model when all the features were included in the model. Moreover, the highest overall detection accuracy of 81.9 \% using the RF model was achieved considering only vehicle kinematics-based features, indicating that the proposed model could be utilized when other data are not available. Furthermore, the analysis of the impact of weather conditions on lane change detection suggested that incorporating weather could improve the accuracy of lane change detection. In addition, the analysis of early lane change detection indicated that the proposed algorithm could predict the lane changes within 5 s before the vehicles cross the lane line. The developed detection models could be used to monitor and control driver behavior in a Cooperative Automated Vehicle environment.},

addendum = {While the study exhibited the capability of Machine Learning algorithms
to detect lane change maneuvers from the SHRP2 NDS and
RID datasets, some limitations should be mentioned. The first limitation
is related to the data segmentation approach. The study considered a
dynamic segmentation approach to select non-lane change segments.
This approach is appropriate and necessary when machine vision-based
features (e.g., lane position offset in this study) are included in the
dataset. Therefore, the study recommends to use fixed time window
approach in the absence of machine vision data in the future. The
second limitation is related to the steering wheel angle variable, which
was not considered for detecting lane change behavior due to excessive
missing values in most of the trips. In addition, data from all surrounding
vehicles were not available as front-mounted radar of NDS
vehicle cannot detect the presence of vehicles behind the NDS vehicle’s
lane. Consequently, the lane change was considered as a single behavior
of the subject vehicle. Future studies can focus on incorporating data
from all surrounding vehicles as the input of the detection algorithm
using similar trajectory-level data with information from all surrounding
vehicles. Moreover, the study is only limited to trips on
freeways. Lane change detection models using the SHRP2 NDS data on
urban roadways could be considered in future studies.
Furthermore, the continuation of this study is important to include
other driver behavioral features in addition to driver demographics in
the developed detection algorithm. To be specific, drivers’ aggressiveness
could be considered in future studies. The lane change events
database developed in this study contained a number of features that
could be used to classify drivers’ aggressiveness. Features associated
with driving behavior, such as speed, acceleration, yaw rate, speed
differences from speed limit, number of lane changes per mile, etc.
could be obtained, and then cluster analysis could be adopted with
possible features to classify drivers as aggressive or conservative. Once
all drivers are classified, they could be introduced as conservative or
aggressive in the current model. Finally, the expansion of this study
would be to include other relevant features and develop more advanced
lane change detection models using Artificial Intelligence and Deep
Learning for specific lane change types and extend the work to predict
lane changes.

abstract = {Road accidents are globally accepted challenges. They are one of the significant causes of deaths and injuries besides other direct and indirect losses. Countries and international organizations have designed technologies, systems, and policies to prevent accidents. However, hit-and-run accidents remain one of the most dangerous types of road accidents as the information about the vehicle responsible for the accident remain unknown. Therefore, any mechanism which can provide information about the impacting vehicle in hit-and-run accidents will be useful in planning and executing preventive measures to address this road menace. Since there exist several models to predict the impacting unknown vehicle, it becomes important to find which is the most accurate amongst those available. This research applies a process-based approach that identifies the most accurate model out of six supervised learning classification models viz. Logistic Reasoning, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naïve Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine. These models are implemented using five-fold and ten-fold cross validation, on road accident data collected from five mid-sized Indian cities: Agra, Amritsar, Bhopal, Ludhiana, and Vizag (Vishakhapatnam).This study investigates the possible input factors that may have effect on the performance of applied models. Based on the results of the experiment conducted in this study, Support Vector Machine has been found to have the maximum potentiality to predict unknown impacting vehicle type in hit-and-run accidents for all the cities except Amritsar. The result indicates that, Classification and Regression Trees have maximum accuracy, for Amritsar. Naïve Bayes performed very poorly for the five cities. These recommendations will help in predicting unknown impacting vehicles in hit-and-run accidents. The outcome is useful for transportation authorities and policymakers to implement effective road safety measures for the safety of road users.},

abstract = {Fatigue negatively affects the safety and performance of drivers on the road. In fact, drowsiness and fatigue are the cause of a substantial number of motor vehicle accidents. Drowsiness among the drivers can be detected using variety of modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), eye movement, and vehicle driving dynamics. Among these EEG is highly accurate but very intrusive and cumbersome. On the other hand, vehicle driving dynamics are very easy to acquire but accuracy is not very high. Eye movement based approach is very attractive in terms of balance between these two extremes. However, eye movement based techniques normally require an eye tracking device which consists of high speed camera with sophisticated algorithm to extract eye movement related parameters such as blinking, eye closure, saccades, fixation etc. This makes eye tracking based drowsiness detection difficult to implement as a practical system, especially on an embedded platform. In this paper, authors propose to use eye images from camera directly without the need for expensive eye-tracking system. Here, eye related movements are captured by Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect the drowsiness. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a class of RNN which has several advantages over vanilla RNNs. In this work an array of LSTM cells are utilized to model the eye movements. Two types of LSTMs were employed: 1-D LSTM (R-LSTM) which is used as baseline and the convolutional LSTM (C-LSTM) which facilitates using 2-D images directly. Patches of size 48 × 48 around each eye were extracted from 38 subjects, participating in a simulated driving experiment. The state of vigilance among the subjects were independently assessed by power spectral analysis of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, recorded simultaneously, and binary labels of alert and drowsy (baseline) were generated. Results show high efficacy of the proposed system. R-LSTM based approach resulted in accuracy around 82 \% and C-LSTM based approach resulted in accuracy in the range of 95\%–97\%. Comparison is also provided with a recently published eye-tracking based approach, showing the proposed LSTM technique outperform with a wide margin.},

abstract = {Safety performance functions (SPFs) are crash count prediction models that are used for identifying high crash risk locations, evaluating road safety before and after countermeasure deployment and comparing the safety of alternative site designs. The traditional method of modeling crash counts is negative binomial (NB) regression. Furthermore, the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) provides analytical tools, including NB SPFs, to assess and improve road safety. Even though the HSM’s SPFs are restricted to NB models, the road safety literature is rich with a variety of different modeling techniques. Researchers have calibrated the HSM’s SPFs to local conditions using a calibration method prescribed by the HSM. However, studies in which SPFs are developed and transferred to other localities are uncommon. In this paper, we develop and transfer rural divided multilane highway segment SPFs of Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, California, Washington and North Carolina to each state. For every state, NB, zero-inflated NB, Poisson lognormal (PLN), regression tree, random forest (RF), boosting and Tobit models are developed. A hybrid model that coalesces the predictions of both the Tobit and the NB model is proposed and developed as well. All SPFs are transferred to each state and their predictive performances are evaluated to discern which model type is the most transferable. According to the transferability results, there is no single superior model type. However, the Tobit, RF, tree, NB and hybrid models demonstrate better predictive performances than those of the other methods in a considerably large proportion of transferred SPFs.},
institution = {U of Central Florida},
annotation = {Interesting.  Comparison of different models (ML and statistical) on different datasets from different states.},
addendum = {Undoubtedly, this paper’s research is not without limitations. All
SPFs, developed and transferred, suffer from omitted variable bias
(Lord and Mannering, 2010) which results in errors associated with the
estimates of the independent variables’ coefficients. Collecting data
about more variables common to all the seven states is a challenge but
worth the endeavor. Random parameters are also not taken into consideration.
Mannering et al. (2016) assert that omitting random parameters
inhibits the capturing of unobserved heterogeneity effects.
However, incorporating random parameters renders the SPFs to be not
transferable to other settings (Mannering et al., 2016). Incorporating
finite mixture effects and random effects into the SPFs may also deter
SPF transferability (Lord and Mannering, 2010). Furthermore, the
generalized additive model and the hierarchical model structures are
not attempted because they are also difficult to transfer to data of
jurisdictions elsewhere (Lord and Mannering, 2010). Other than the
regression techniques that are difficult to transfer, it should be noted
that there are several viable techniques that could’ve been attempted.
The transferability of Conway-Maxwell Poisson, gamma, negative
multinomial, multivariate and generalized estimating equation SPFs
(Lord and Mannering, 2010) is worth investigating. Another shortcoming
is that the Tobit, RF, tree and hybrid models, recommended, are
not applicable to before-and-after countermeasure deployment analysis
using the empirical Bayes (EB) method prescribed by the HSM. The EB
method depends on weights which are a function of the overdispersion
of the NB model. Yet, Tobit, RF, tree and hybrid structures are applicable
for evaluating the safety of alternative road designs.

The two goals of this study are (a) to build a conceptual framework for driver assessment and (b) develop recommendation systems to evaluate individual driving performance and guide driver behaviors, thus improving the network traffic conditions and individuals’ perceived safety. A safety score is defined relatively by comparing a driver’s individual pattern to a standard “safe driver” pattern. To elaborate, the proposed system adopts advanced data mining techniques to extract, identify, characterize, and display driving behavior patterns. The scoring system provides a basis of assessing individual drivers, who are then recommended to mimic a nearby “safe” driver in a connected environment. To evaluate and implement the proposed conceptual framework, an anonymous trajectory dataset collected from Pittsburgh urban area is applied to build the scoring system, which is then integrated within a virtually simulated environment. The results show that the proposed behavior assessment and recommendation system framework improves the overall performance of a connected traffic system beyond those attained through baseline connectivity principles.},

levels of connectivity for longer tests with more vehicles within other

data library could be improved by introducing more trajectory data in
addition to other types of data describing the driving situations, particularly
weather, road conditions, and the driving culture (i.e. social
norms) in the area/city/country where the driving data is collected.
Third, the proposed system is extendable to an on-line case which can
be updated in real-time. Fourth, as stated in Section 5.2, the importance
of compliance rate could be further explored with a set of more systematically
designed experiments. With additional training data and
more robust simulations, the attractiveness of this system for deploying
a wider range of traffic management interventions and individual driver
guidance is indeed possible.}

Lane-keeping ability is a lateral driver behavior that can be very crucial in run-off-road crashes under reduced visibility conditions. A number of data mining techniques have been adopted in previous studies to examine driver behavior including lane-keeping ability. This study adopted an association rules mining method, a promising data mining technique, to investigate driver lane-keeping ability in foggy weather conditions using big trajectory-level SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) datasets. A total of 124 trips in fog with their corresponding 248 trips in clear weather (i.e., 2 clear trips: 1 foggy weather trip) were considered for the study. The results indicated that affected visibility was associated with poor lane-keeping performance in several rules. Furthermore, additional factors including male drivers, a higher number of lanes, the presence of horizontal curves, etc. were found to be significant factors for having a higher proportion of poor lane-keeping performance. Moreover, drivers with more miles driven last year were found to have better lane-keeping performance.

This paper had three main objectives: comparison of the performance of four statistical and machine learning methods including Multinomial Logit (MNL), Nearest Neighbor Classification (NNC), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF), in predicting traffic crash severity; developing a crash costs-based approach for comparison of crash severity prediction methods; and investigating the effects of data clustering methods comprising K-means Clustering (KC) and Latent Class Clustering (LCC), on the performance of crash severity prediction models. The 2012–2015 reported crash data from Nebraska, United States was obtained and two-vehicle crashes were extracted as the analysis data. The dataset was split into training/estimation (2012–2014) and validation (2015) subsets. The four prediction methods were trained/estimated using the training/estimation dataset and the correct prediction rates for each crash severity level, overall correct prediction rate and a proposed crash costs-based accuracy measure were obtained for the validation dataset. The correct prediction rates and the proposed approach showed NNC had the best prediction performance in overall and in more severe crashes. RF and SVM had the next two sufficient performances and MNL was the weakest method. Data clustering did not affect the prediction results of SVM, but KC improved the prediction performance of MNL, NNC and RF, while LCC caused improvement in MNL and RF but weakened the performance of NNC. Overall correct prediction rate had almost the exact opposite results compared to the proposed approach, showing that neglecting the crash costs can lead to misjudgment in choosing the right prediction method.},

By means of the online platform CrowdFlower, we investigated the potential of crowdsourcing to categorize driving scene features (i.e., presence of other road users, straight road segments, etc.) at greater scale than a single person or a small team of researchers would be capable of. In total, 200 workers from 46 different countries participated in 1.5days. Validity and reliability were examined, both with and without embedding researcher generated control questions via the CrowdFlower mechanism known as Gold Test Questions (GTQs). By employing GTQs, we found significantly more valid (accurate) and reliable (consistent) identification of driving scene items from external workers. Specifically, at a small scale CrowdFlower Job of 48 three-second video segments, an accuracy (i.e., relative to the ratings of a confederate researcher) of 91\% on items was found with GTQs compared to 78\% without. A difference in bias was found, where without GTQs, external workers returned more false positives than with GTQs. At a larger scale CrowdFlower Job making exclusive use of GTQs, 12,862 three-second video segments were released for annotation. Infeasible (and self-defeating) to check the accuracy of each at this scale, a random subset of 1012 categorizations was validated and returned similar levels of accuracy (95\%). In the small scale Job, where full video segments were repeated in triplicate, the percentage of unanimous agreement on the items was found significantly more consistent when using GTQs (90\%) than without them (65\%). Additionally, in the larger scale Job (where a single second of a video segment was overlapped by ratings of three sequentially neighboring segments), a mean unanimity of 94\% was obtained with validated-as-correct ratings and 91\% with non-validated ratings. Because the video segments overlapped in full for the small scale Job, and in part for the larger scale Job, it should be noted that such reliability reported here may not be directly comparable. Nonetheless, such results are both indicative of high levels of obtained rating reliability. Overall, our results provide compelling evidence for CrowdFlower, via use of GTQs, being able to yield more accurate and consistent crowdsourced categorizations of naturalistic driving scene contents than when used without such a control mechanism. Such annotations in such short periods of time present a potentially powerful resource in driving research and driving automation development.},

It proposes a data-driven model which combines the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) with the Neural Network (NN) architecture to efficiently search for optimal solutions. This paper also defines the index of Factor Significance (Fs) for quantitative evaluation of the significance of each factor. Based on a set of three year data of crash records collected from three main interstate highways in the Washington State, the proposed method reveals that the top five significant factors for a better Fatal-injury crash identification are 1) Driver Conduct, 2) Vehicle Action, 3) Roadway Surface Condition, 4) Driver Restraint and 5) Driver Age. The most sensitive factors from a spatiotemporal perspective are the Hour of Day, Most Severe Sobriety, and Roadway Characteristics. The method and results in this paper provide new insights into the injury pattern of highway crashes and may be used to improve the understanding of, prevention of, and other enforcement efforts related to injury crashes in the future.},

The distracted driving epidemic has long been under research to identify its impact on driving behavior. There have been a few attempts to detect drivers’ engagement in secondary tasks from observed driving behavior. Yet, to the authors’ knowledge, not much effort has been directed to identify the types of secondary tasks from driving behavior parameters. This study proposes a bi-level hierarchical classification methodology using machine learning to identify the different types of secondary tasks drivers are engaged in using their driving behavior parameters. At the first level, drivers’ engagement in secondary tasks is detected, while at the second level, the distinct types of secondary tasks are identified. Comparative evaluation is performed between nine ensemble tree classification methods to identify three types of secondary tasks (hand-held cellphone calling, cellphone texting, and interaction with an adjacent passenger). The inputs to the models are five driving behavior parameters (speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, pedal position, and yaw rate) along with their standard deviations. The results showed that the overall secondary task detection accuracy ranged from 66\% to 96\%, except for the Decision Tree that was able to detect engagement in secondary tasks with a high accuracy of 99.8\%. For the identification of secondary tasks types, the overall accuracy ranged from 55\% to 79\%, with the highest accuracy of 82.2\% achieved by the Random Forest method. The findings of the paper show the proposed methodology promising to (1) characterize drivers’ engagement in unlawful secondary tasks (such as texting) as a counter measure to prevent crashes, and (2) alert drivers to pay attention back to the main driving task when risky changes to their driving behavior take place.},

In the model validation, the performance of the Stacking model is compared with several traditional models including the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forests (RF) in the multi classification experiments. The prediction results show that Stacking model achieves superior performance evaluated by two indicators: accuracy and recall. Furthermore, all the factors used in severity prediction are classified into different categories according to their influence on the results, and sensitivity analysis of several significant factors is finally implemented to explore the impact of their value variation on the prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Driving distraction is a leading cause of fatal car accidents, and almost nine people are killed in the US each day because of distracting activities. Therefore, reducing the number of distraction-affected traffic accidents remains an imperative issue. A novel algorithm for detection of drivers’ manual distraction was proposed in this manuscript. The detection algorithm consists of two modules. The first module predicts the bounding boxes of the driver's right hand and right ear from RGB images. The second module takes the bounding boxes as input and predicts the type of distraction. 106,677 frames extracted from videos, which were collected from twenty participants in a driving simulator, were used for training (50\%) and testing (50\%). For distraction classification, the results indicated that the proposed framework could detect normal driving, using the touchscreen, and talking with a phone with F1-score 0.84, 0.69, 0.82, respectively. For overall distraction detection, it achieved F1-score of 0.74. The whole framework ran at 28 frames per second. The algorithm achieved comparable overall accuracy with similar research, and was more efficient than other methods. A demo video for the algorithm can be found at https://youtu.be/NKclK1bHRd4.},

abstract = {One of the proactive approaches in reducing traffic crashes is to identify hazardous traffic conditions that may lead to a traffic crash, known as real-time crash prediction. Threshold selection is one of the essential steps of real-time crash prediction. And it provides the cut-off point for the posterior probability which is used to separate potential crash warnings against normal traffic conditions, after the outcome of the probability of a crash occurring given a specific traffic condition on the basis of crash risk evaluation models. There is however a dearth of research that focuses on how to effectively determine an optimal threshold. And only when discussing the predictive performance of the models, a few studies utilized subjective methods to choose the threshold. The subjective methods cannot automatically identify the optimal thresholds in different traffic and weather conditions in real application. Thus, a theoretical method to select the threshold value is necessary for the sake of avoiding subjective judgments. The purpose of this study is to provide a theoretical method for automatically identifying the optimal threshold. Considering the random effects of variable factors across all roadway segments, the mixed logit model was utilized to develop the crash risk evaluation model and further evaluate the crash risk. Cross-entropy, between-class variance and other theories were employed and investigated to empirically identify the optimal threshold. And K-fold cross-validation was used to validate the performance of proposed threshold selection methods with the help of several evaluation criteria. The results indicate that (i) the mixed logit model can obtain a good performance; (ii) the classification performance of the threshold selected by the minimum cross-entropy method outperforms the other methods according to the criteria. This method can be well-behaved to automatically identify thresholds in crash prediction, by minimizing the cross entropy between the original dataset with continuous probability of a crash occurring and the binarized dataset after using the thresholds to separate potential crash warnings against normal traffic conditions.},

Twenty-one participants drove a car simulator for 110 min in a monotonous environment. We measured physiological and behavioral indicators and recorded driving behavior. These measurements, in addition to driving time and personal information, served as the ANN inputs. Two ANN-based models were used, one to detect the level of drowsiness every minute, and the other to predict, every minute, how long it would take the driver to reach a specific drowsiness level (moderately drowsy). The ANNs were trained with 20 participants and subsequently adapted using the earliest part of the data recorded from a 21st participant. Then the adapted ANNs were tested with the remaining data from this 21st participant. The same procedure was run for all 21 participants. Varying amounts of data were used to adapt the ANNs, from 1 to 30 min, Model performance was enhanced for each participant. The overall drowsiness monitoring performance of the models was enhanced by roughly 40\% for prediction and 80\% for detection.},

Testing on public roads is currently undergoing, with many AV makers located and testing in Silicon Valley, California.

Disengagements data is analyzed in this work, given the safety-critical role of AV disengagements, which require the control of the vehicle to be handed back to the human driver in a safe and timely manner. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the fragmented data obtained from AV manufacturers testing on California public roads from 2014 to 2017. Trends of disengagement reporting, associated frequencies, average mileage driven before failure, and an analysis of triggers and contributory factors are here presented. The analysis of the disengagements data also highlights several shortcomings of the current regulations. The results presented thus constitute an important starting point for improvements on the current drafts of the testing and deployment regulations for autonomous vehicles on public roads.},

abstract = {Run-off-road (ROR) crashes have always been a major concern as this type of crash is usually associated with a considerable number of serious injury and fatal crashes. A substantial portion of ROR fatalities occur in collisions with fixed objects at the roadside. Thus, this study seeks to investigate the severity of ROR crashes where elderly drivers, aged 65 years or more, hit a fixed object. The reason why the present study investigates this issue among older drivers is that, comparing to younger drivers, this age group of drivers have different psychological and physical features. Because of these differences, they are more likely to get injured in ROR types of crashes. This paper applies two types of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including hybrid Intelligent Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the crashe information of California in 2012 obtained from Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) database. Although the results showed that the developed ANN outperformed the hybrid Intelligent Genetic Algorithm, the hybrid approach was more capable of predicting high-severity crashes. This is rooted in the way the hybrid model was trained by taking advantage of the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The results also indicated that the light condition has been the most significant parameter in evaluating the level of severity associated with fixed object crashes among elderly drivers, which is followed by the existence of the right and left shoulders. Following these three contributing factors, cause of collision, Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT), number of involved vehicles, age, road surface condition, and gender have been identified as the most important variables in the developed ANN, respectively. This helps to identify gaps and improve public safety towards improving the overall highway safety situation of older drivers.},

The methodology is divided in four main modules which analyze the accessibility of the crossing area, the presence of traffic lights and traffic signs, and the visibility between a driver and a pedestrian on the proximities of a pedestrian crossing. The outputs of the analysis are exported to a Geographic Information System (GIS) where they are visualized and can be further processed in the context of city management. The methodology has been tested on approximately 30 pedestrian crossings in cluttered urban environments of two different cities. Results show that MMS are a valid mean to assess the safety of a specific urban environment, regarding its geometric conditions.

This psychological driving simulator experiment investigated how to warn drivers visually in order to prevent accidents in various safety-critical situations. Collision frequencies, driving behavior and subjective evaluations of situation criticality, warning understandability and helpfulness of sixty drivers were measured in two trials of eight scenarios each (within-subjects factors). The warning type in the head-up display (HUD) varied (between-subjects) in its strategy (attention-/reaction-oriented) and specificity (generic/specific) over four warning groups and a control group without a warning. The results show that the scenarios differed in their situation criticality and drivers adapted their reactions accordingly, which underlines the importance of testing driver assistance systems in diverse scenarios. Besides some learning effects over the trials, all warned drivers showed faster and stronger brake reactions. Some warning concepts were understood better than others, but all were accepted. Generic warnings were effective, yet the warning strategy should adapt to situation requirements and/or driver behavior. A stop symbol as reaction generic warning is recommendable for diverse kinds of use cases, leading to fast and strong reactions. However, for rather moderate driver reactions an attention generic approach with a caution symbol might be more suitable. Further research should investigate multi-stage warnings with adaptive strategies for application to various situations including other modalities and false alarms.},

In this paper, we propose a crash prediction method based on a bivariate extreme value theory (EVT) framework, considering both drivers’ perception-reaction failure and failure to proper evasive actions. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized to collect videos of ten intersections in Fengxian, China, at representative time periods. High-resolution vehicle trajectory data were extracted by a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) technique, based on four detailed metrics were derived including Time-to-accident (TA), Post-encroachment Time (PET), minimum Time-to-collision (mTTC), and Maximum Deceleration Rate (MaxD). TA was expected to capture the chance of perception-reaction failure, while other three metrics were used to measure the probability of failure to proper evasive actions. Univariate EVT models were applied to obtain marginal crash probability based on each metric. Bivariate EVT models were developed to obtain joint crash probability based on three pairs: TA and mTTC, TA and PET, and TA and MaxD. Thus, union crash probability within observation periods can be derived and the annual crash frequency of each intersection was predicted. The predictions were compared to actual annual crash frequencies, using multiple tests. The findings are three-folds: 1. The best conflict metrics for angle and rear-end crash predictions were different; 2. Bivariate EVT models were found to be superior to univariate models, regarding both angle and rear-end crash predictions; 3. TA appeared to be an important conflict metric that should be considered in a bivariate EVT model framework. In general, the proposed method can be considered as a promising tool for safety evaluation, when crash data are limited.},

Predicting the impacts of lane change can help to develop optimal lane change strategies of autonomous vehicles for safety improvement. The study aims at proposing a machine learning method for the short-term prediction of lane-changing impacts (LCI) during the propagation of traffic oscillations. The empirical lane-changing trajectory records were obtained from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) platform. A support vector regression (SVR) model was trained in this study to predict the LCI on the crash risks and flow change using microscopic traffic variables such as individual speed, gap and acceleration on both original lanes and target lanes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in the SVR to quantify the contributions of correlative lane changing factors. The results showed that the trained SVR model achieved an accuracy of 72.81 \% for the risk of crashes and 95.34 \% in predicting the flow change. The sensitivity analysis explored the optimal speed and acceleration for the lane changer to achieve the lowest time integrated time-to-collision (TIT) value for safety maximization. Finally, we compared the LCI for motorcycles, automobiles and trucks as well as the LCI for both lane-changing directions (from left to right and from right to left). It was found that motorcycles conducted lane changes with smaller gaps and larger speed differences, which brings the highest crash risks. Passenger cars were found to be the safest when they conduct lane changes. Lane changes to the right had more negative impacts on traffic flow and crash risks.},

abstract = {The continuous motorization of traffic has led to a sustained increase in the global number of road related fatalities and injuries. To counter this, governments are focusing on enforcing safe and law-abiding behavior in traffic. However, especially in developing countries where the motorcycle is the main form of transportation, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the safety-critical behavioral metric of motorcycle helmet use. This lack of data prohibits targeted enforcement and education campaigns which are crucial for injury prevention. Hence, we have developed an algorithm for the automated registration of motorcycle helmet usage from video data, using a deep learning approach. Based on 91,000 annotated frames of video data, collected at multiple observation sites in 7 cities across the country of Myanmar, we trained our algorithm to detect active motorcycles, the number and position of riders on the motorcycle, as well as their helmet use. An analysis of the algorithm's accuracy on an annotated test data set, and a comparison to available human-registered helmet use data reveals a high accuracy of our approach. Our algorithm registers motorcycle helmet use rates with an accuracy of −4.4\% and +2.1\% in comparison to a human observer, with minimal training for individual observation sites. Without observation site specific training, the accuracy of helmet use detection decreases slightly, depending on a number of factors. Our approach can be implemented in existing roadside traffic surveillance infrastructure and can facilitate targeted data-driven injury prevention campaigns with real-time speed. Implications of the proposed method, as well as measures that can further improve detection accuracy are discussed.},

similar limitation can be seen in the position of the observation camera.
While the algorithm is able to detect motorcycles from a broad range of
angles due to diverse training data, there was no observation site where
the observation camera was installed in an overhead position, filming
traffic from above. Since traffic surveillance infrastructure is often installed
at this position, future studies will need to assess whether the
algorithm would produce accurate results from an overhead angle. This
is especially important in light of the results of the Yangon II observation
site, where an unusual camera angle lead to a large number of
missed detections. Furthermore, a more structured variation of camera
to lane angle would help to better understand optimal positioning of
observation equipment for maximum detection accuracy. While it was
included in the data annotation process, the algorithmic accuracy in
detecting the position of riders was not compared to human registered
data in this study. In light of large differences of motorcycle helmet use
for different rider positions (Siebert et al., 2019), future studies will
need to incorporate deeper analysis of position detection accuracy. For
the comparison of human- and machine-registered helmet use rates, it
appears promising to enable a detailed error analysis (false positive/
false negative) through the use of an adapted data structure of human
helmet use registration.}

abstract = {Real-time risk assessment of autonomous driving at tactical and operational levels is extremely challenging since both contextual and circumferential factors should concurrently be considered. Recent methods have started to simultaneously treat the context of the traffic environment along with vehicle dynamics. In particular, interaction-aware motion models that take inter-vehicle dependencies into account by utilizing the Bayesian interference are employed to mutually control multiple factors. However, communications between vehicles are often assumed and the developed models are required many parameters to be tuned. Consequently, they are computationally very demanding. Even in the cases where these desiderata are fulfilled, current approaches cannot cope with a large volume of sequential data from organically changing traffic scenarios, especially in highly complex operational environments such as dense urban areas with heterogeneous road users. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a new risk assessment methodology that integrates a network-level collision estimate with a vehicle-based risk estimate in real-time under the joint framework of interaction-aware motion models and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN). Following the formulation and explanation of the required functions, machine learning classifiers were utilized for the real-time network-level collision prediction and the results were then incorporated into the integrated DBN model for predicting collision probabilities in real-time. Results indicated an enhancement of the interaction-aware model by up to 10\%, when traffic conditions are deemed as collision-prone. Hence, it was concluded that a well-calibrated collision prediction classifier provides a crucial hint for better risk perception by autonomous vehicles.},

Twenty-one participants drove a car simulator for 110min under conditions optimized to induce drowsiness. We measured physiological and behavioral indicators such as heart rate and variability, respiration rate, head and eyelid movements (blink duration, frequency and PERCLOS) and recorded driving behavior such as time-to-lane-crossing, speed, steering wheel angle, position on the lane. Different combinations of this information were tested against the real state of the driver, namely the ground truth, as defined from video recordings via the Trained Observer Rating. Two models using artificial neural networks were developed, one to detect the degree of drowsiness every minute, and the other to predict every minute the time required to reach a particular drowsiness level (moderately drowsy). The best performance in both detection and prediction is obtained with behavioral indicators and additional information. The model can detect the drowsiness level with a mean square error of 0.22 and can predict when a given drowsiness level will be reached with a mean square error of 4.18min. This study shows that, on a controlled and very monotonous environment conducive to drowsiness in a driving simulator, the dynamics of driver impairment can be predicted.},

abstract = {The crash prediction model is a useful tool for traffic administrators to identify significant risk factors, estimate crash frequency, and screen hazardous locations, but some jurisdictions interested in traffic safety analysis can collect only limited or low-quality data. Existing crash prediction models can be transferred if calibrated, but the current aggregate calibration method limits prediction accuracy and the disaggregate method is resource-consuming. Transfer learning is another approach to calibration that acquires knowledge from old data domains to solve problems in new data domains. An instance-based transfer learning technique, TrAdaBoost.R2, is adopted in this study since it meets the requirement of site-based crash prediction model transfer. TrAdaBoost.R2 was compared with AdaBoost.R2 using a simply pooled data set to examine the efficiency in extracting knowledge from a spatially outdated source data domain (old data domain). The target data domain (new data domain) was sampled to test the technique’s adaptability to small sample size. The calibration factor method based on a negative binomial model was employed to compare its predictive performance with that of the transfer learning technique. Mean square error was calculated to evaluate the prediction accuracy. Two cities in China, Shanghai and Guangzhou, were taken mutually as source data domain and target data domain. Results showed that the models constructed with TrAdaBoost.R2 had better prediction accuracy than the conventional calibration method. The TrAdaBoost.R2 is recommended due to its predictive performance and adaptability to small sample size. Crash prediction models are proposed to construct for peak and off-peak hours separately.},

abstract = {Proactive traffic safety management systems can monitor traffic conditions in real-time, identify the formation of unsafe traffic dynamics, and implement suitable interventions to bring unsafe conditions back to normal traffic situations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor fusion and algorithms have brought about the introduction of a proactive safety management system closer to reality. The basic prerequisite for developing such a system is to have a reliable crash prediction model that takes real-time traffic data as input and evaluates their association with crash risk. Since the early 21st century, several studies have focused on developing such models. Although the idea has considerably matured over time, the endeavours have been quite discrete and fragmented at best because the fundamental aspects of the overall modelling approach substantially vary. Therefore, a number of transitional challenges have to be identified and subsequently addressed before a ubiquitous proactive safety management system can be formulated, designed and implemented in real-world scenarios. This manuscript conducts a comprehensive review of existing real-time crash prediction models with the aim of illustrating the state-of-the-art and systematically synthesizing the thoughts presented in existing studies in order to facilitate its translation from an idea into a ready to use technology. Towards that journey, it conducts a systematic review by applying various text mining methods and topic modelling. Based on the findings, this paper ascertains the development pathways followed in various studies, formulates the ubiquitous design requirements of such models from existing studies and knowledge of similar systems. Finally, this study evaluates the universality and design compatibility of existing models. This paper is, therefore, expected to serve as a one stop knowledge source for facilitating a faster transition from the idea of real-time crash prediction models to a real-world operational proactive traffic safety management system.},

In this study, a methodology to obtain robust and unbiased results when modeling imbalanced, high-resolution accident data is described. Based on a data set covering the whole highway network of Austria in a fine spatial (250 m) and temporal (1 h) scale, the effects of 48 covariates on accident occurrence are analyzed, with a special emphasis on real-time weather variables obtained through meteorological re-analysis. A balanced bagging approach is employed to cope with the issue of class imbalance. By fitting different tree-based classifiers to a large number of bootstrapped training samples, ensembles of binary classification models are established. The final prediction is achieved through majority vote across each ensemble, resulting in a robust prediction with reduced variance. Findings show the merits of the proposed approach in terms of model quality and robustness of the results, consistently displaying accuracies around 80\% while exhibiting sensitivities of approximately 50\%. In addition to certain features related to roadway geometrics, surface condition and traffic volume, a number of weather variables are found to be of importance for predicting accident occurrence. The proposed methodological take may not only pave the way for further analyses of high-resolution road safety data including real-time information, but can also be transferred to any other imbalanced classification problem.},

Thus, we are interested in predicting fatal motorcycle accidents (FMAs), and in identifying their key factors and possible causes. Accurate prediction of YD FMAs from data by risk minimization using the 0/1 loss function (i.e., the ordinary classification accuracy) cannot be guaranteed because these accidents are only ∼1\% of all YD motorcycle accidents, and classifiers tend to focus on the majority class of minor accidents at the expense of the minority class of fatal ones. Also, classifiers are usually uninformative (providing no information about the distribution of misclassifications), insensitive to error severity (making no distinction between misclassification of fatal accidents as severe or minor), and limited in identifying key factors. We propose to use an information measure (IM) that jointly maximizes accuracy and information and is sensitive to the error distribution and severity. Using a database of ∼3600 motorcycle accidents, a Bayesian network classifier optimized by IM predicted FMAs better than classifiers maximizing accuracy or other predictive or information measures, and identified fatal accident key factors and causal relations.},

The crash risk expressed as the potential crash likelihood is assessed under variable speed limit (VSL) and without VSL, in which both spatial correlation between different sites and temporal similarity are contained. Traffic flow data of Whitemud Drive network (WMD) in Canada is used to perform the relevant analysis, including VSL implementation analysis, traffic flow similarity analysis, crash risk and congestion analysis. Analytical results demonstrate that the average traffic flow under VSL schemes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are highly correlated from spatial-temporal perspective. The crash likelihoods and congestions under these VSL schemes are greatly improved. The best VSL control scheme, the most dangerous area and time, together with the most congested station of WMD are eventually determined. Subsequently, a t-test is employed to examine the significance of these results. t-Test results suggest that the improvement degree between crash risk and congestion under the best VSL control scheme show a difference, i.e., the best VSL control scheme can reduce the crash risk of moderate risk area more than high risk area, while it may have a larger melioration on the most congested area than the relatively uncongested area. Finally, these results are considered to have the potential reference in the mitigation of WMD traffic issues.},

This model can explicitly learn from the various features, such as traffic flow characteristics, signal timing, and weather conditions. Specifically, LSTM captures the long-term dependency while CNN extracts the time-invariant features. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is used for resampling the training dataset. Five common models are developed to compare the results with the proposed model, such as the XGBoost, Bayesian Logistics Regression, LSTM, etc. Experiments suggest that the proposed model outperforms others in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) value, sensitivity, and false alarm rate.

This study uses data collected from Manhattan in New York City to illustrate the procedure. The following multiple datasets are collected: crash data, large-scale taxi GPS data, road network attributes, land use features, population data and weather data. A spatiotemporal convolutional long short-term memory network (STCL-Net) is proposed for predicting the citywide short-term crash risk. A total of nine prediction tasks are conducted and compared, including weekly, daily and hourly models with 8 × 3, 15 × 5 and 30 × 10 grids, respectively. The results suggest that the prediction performance of the proposed model decreases as the spatiotemporal resolution of prediction task increases. Moreover, four commonly-used econometric models, and four state-of-the-art machine-learning models are selected as benchmark methods to compare with the proposed STCL-Net for all the crash risk prediction tasks. The comparative analyses suggest that in general the proposed STCL-Net outperforms the benchmark methods for different crash risk prediction tasks in terms of higher prediction accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate. The results verify that the proposed spatiotemporal deep learning approach performs better at capturing the spatiotemporal characteristics for the citywide short-term crash risk prediction. In addition, the comparative analyses also reveal that econometric models perform better than machine-learning models in weekly crash risk prediction tasks, while they exhibit worse results than machine-learning models in daily crash risk prediction tasks.

This study presents a research framework for key feature selection and risk prediction of car’s LC behavior on the highway based on vehicles’ trajectory dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on key feature selection and risk prediction for LC behavior on the highway. From the vehicles’ trajectory dataset, we extract car’s candidate features and apply fault tree analysis and k-Means clustering algorithm to determine the LC risk level based on the performance indicator of Crash Potential Index (CPI). Random Forest (RF) classifier is applied to select key features from car’s candidate features and predict LC risk level. This study also proposes a method to evaluate the resampling methods to resample the LC risk dataset in terms of fitness performance and prediction performance. The cars’ trajectory data collected from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset is used for framework development and verification. The sensitivity analysis of CPI indicates that the following cars in the original lane and target lane are respectively the safest and riskiest cars of the surrounding cars in an LC event. The results of resampling method evaluation show that SMOTETomek, which is less likely to be overfitting and has high prediction performance, is well suited for resampling the LC risk dataset on which RF classifier is trained. The results of key feature selection imply that the individual behaviors of the LC car and its surrounding cars in the original lane, the interactions between the LC car and its surrounding cars, and the interactions between the surrounding cars in the target lane (especially the interaction of the cars’ accelerations) are of importance to the LC risk.},

Effective enforcement of mobile phone bans while driving faces several obstacles; as such, it is important to consider additional countermeasures. Applications designed to prevent distracted driving are a promising solution, yet more research is needed that examines their effectiveness in reducing dangerous phone use while driving behaviours. Additionally, these applications are voluntary in nature; therefore, an understanding of drivers’ perceptions of the applications is necessary to determine how to improve uptake. A mixed methods design was utilised to examine these factors in a comprehensive manner. A total of 40 participants used the smartphone application “Do Not Disturb While Driving” for iOS phone operating systems or “Android Auto” for Android phone operating systems for approximately one week and completed three diary entries reporting on their experience. Two questionnaires that examined phone use while driving behaviours were also administered to participants; one before and one after completing the study. The quantitative results found that engagement in 1) visual-manual, 2) cognitive-auditory and 3) music mobile phone interactions significantly decreased while using the application. Distraction engagement and mental workload while driving also significantly decreased while using the application. The qualitative results identified a number of areas of improvement that need to be addressed, e.g. activation of the application and Bluetooth connection reliability. The features that required improvement presented an obstacle for effective use of the applications, and in some cases resulted in drivers deciding to stop using the application. Positive perceptions of the application were associated with the experiences of the application functioning appropriately and activating automatically. These results show that applications designed for voluntary use to prevent mobile phone distracted driving are a promising countermeasure, although current applications require several improvements.},

abstract = {According to the Federal Highway Administration, nonrecurring congestion contributes to nearly half of the overall congestion. Temporal disruptions impact the effective use of the complete roadway, due to speed reduction and rubbernecking resulting from primary incidents that in turn provoke secondary incidents. There is an additional reduction of discharge flow caused by secondary incident that significantly increases total delay. Therefore, it is important to sequentially predict the probability of secondary incidents and develop appropriate countermeasures to reduce the associated risk. Advanced computing techniques were used to easily understand and reliably predict secondary incident occurrences that have low sample mean and a small sample size. The likelihood of a secondary incident was sequentially predicted from the point of incident response to the eventual road clearance. The quality of predictions improved with the availability of additional information. The prediction performance of the principled Bayesian learning approach to neural networks (bnn) was compared to the Stochastic Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (gbdt). A pedagogical rule extraction approach, trepan, which extracts comprehensible rules from the neural networks, improved the ability to understand secondary incidents in a simplified manner. With an acceptable accuracy, gbdt is a useful tool that presents the relative importance of the predictor variables. Unexpected traffic congestion incurred by an incident is a dominant causative factor for the occurrence of secondary incidents at different stages of incident clearance. This symbolic description represents a series of decisions that may assist emergency operators by improving their decision-making capabilities. Analyzing causes and effects of traffic incidents helps traffic operators develop incident-specific strategic plans for prompt emergency response and clearance. Application of the model in connected vehicle environments will help drivers receive proactive corrective feedback before a crash. The proposed methodology can be used to alert drivers about potential highway conditions and may increase the drivers’ awareness of potential events when no rerouting is possible, optimal or otherwise.},

abstract = {Introduction: Classical Machine Learning (ML) models have been found to assign the external-cause-of-injury codes (E-codes) based on injury narratives with good overall accuracy but often struggle with rare categories, primarily due to lack of enough training cases and heavily skewed nature of injurdata. In this paper, we have: a) studied the effect of increasing the size of training data on the prediction performance of three classical ML models: Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), and b) studied the effect of filtering based on prediction strength of LR model when the model is trained on very-small (10,000 cases) and very-large (450,000 cases) training sets.
Method
Data from Queensland Injury Surveillance Unit from years 2002–2012, which was categorized into 20 broad E-codes was used for this study. Eleven randomly chosen training sets of size ranging from 10,000 to 450,000 cases were used to train the ML models, and the prediction performance was analyzed on a prediction set of 50,150 cases. Filtering approach was tested on LR models trained on smallest and largest training datasets. Sensitivity was used as the performance measure for individual categories. Weighted average sensitivity (WAvg) and Unweighted average sensitivity (UAvg) were used as the measures of overall performance. Filtering approach was also tested for estimating category counts and was compared with approaches of summing prediction probabilities and counting direct predictions by ML model.
Results
The overall performance of all three ML models improved with increase in the size of training data. The overall sensitivities with maximum training size for LR and SVM models were similar (∼82\%), and higher than MNB (76\%). For all the ML models, the sensitivities of rare categories improved with increasing training data but they were considerably less than sensitivities of larger categories. With increasing training data size, LR and SVM exhibited diminishing improvement in UAvg whereas the improvement was relatively steady in case of MNB. Filtering based on prediction strength of LR model (and manual review of filtered cases) helped in improving the sensitivities of rare categories. A sizeable portion of cases still needed to be filtered even when the LR model was trained on very large training set. For estimating category counts, filtering approach provided best estimates for most E-codes and summing prediction probabilities approach provided better estimates for rare categories.
Conclusions
Increasing the size of training data alone cannot solve the problem of poor classification performance on rare categories by ML models. Filtering could be an effective strategy to improve classification performance of rare categories when large training data is not available.},

A huge leap forward in the development of new vehicle safety systems are actuators that have to be activated irreversibly shortly before a collision in order to mitigate accident consequences. The triggering decision has to be based on measurements of exteroceptive sensors currently used in driver assistance systems. This paper focuses on developing a novel context-aware system designed to detect potential collisions and to trigger safety actuators even before an accident occurs. In this context, the analysis examines the information that can be collected from exteroceptive sensors (pre-crash data) to predict a certain collision and its severity to decide whether a triggering is entitled or not. A five-layer context-aware architecture is presented, that is able to collect contextual information about the vehicle environment and the actual driving state using different sensors, to perform reasoning about potential collisions, and to trigger safety functions upon that information. Accident analysis is used in a data model to represent uncertain knowledge and to perform reasoning. A simulation concept based on real accident data is introduced to evaluate the presented system concept.},

abstract = {This study investigated driver performance during system limits of partially automated driving. Using a motion-based driving simulator, drivers encountered different situations in which a partially automated vehicle could no longer safely keep the lateral guidance. Drivers were distracted by a non-driving related task on a touch display or driving without an additional secondary task. While driving in partially automated mode drivers could either take their hands off the steering wheel for only a short period of time (10s, so-called ‘Hands-on’ variant) or for an extended period of time (120s, so-called ‘Hands-off’ variant). When the system limit was reached (e.g., when entering a work zone with temporary lines), the lateral vehicle control by the automation was suddenly discontinued and a take-over request was issued to the drivers. Regardless of the hands-off interval and the availability of a secondary task, all drivers managed the transition to manual driving safely. No lane exceedances were observed and the situations were rated as ‘harmless’ by the drivers. The lack of difference between the hands-off intervals can be partly attributed to the fact that most of the drivers kept contact to the steering wheel, even in the hands-off condition. Although all drivers were able to control the system limits, most of them could not explain why exactly the take-over request was issued. The average helpfulness of the take-over request was rated on an intermediate level. Consequently, providing drivers with information about the reason for a system limit can be recommended.},

abstract = {In conditionally automated vehicles, drivers can engage in secondary activities while traveling to their destination. However, drivers are required to appropriately respond, in a limited amount of time, to a take-over request when the system reaches its functional boundaries. Interacting with the car in the proper way from the first ride is crucial for car and road safety in general. For this reason, it is necessary to train drivers in a risk-free environment by providing them the best practice to use these complex systems. In this context, Virtual Reality (VR) systems represent a promising training and learning tool to properly familiarize drivers with the automated vehicle and allow them to interact with the novel equipment involved. In addition, Head-Mounted Display (HMD)-based VR (light VR) would allow for the easy deployment of such training systems in driving schools or car dealerships. In this study, the effectiveness of a light Virtual Reality training program for acquiring interaction skills in automated cars was investigated. The effectiveness of this training was compared to a user manual and a fixed-base simulator with respect to both objective and self-reported measures. Sixty subjects were randomly assigned to one of the systems in which they went through a training phase followed by a test drive in a high-end driving simulator. Results show that the training system affects the take-over performances. Moreover, self-reported measures indicate that the light VR training is preferred with respect to the other systems. Finally, another important outcome of this research is the evidence that VR plays a strategic role in the definition of the set of metrics for profiling proper driver interaction with the automated vehicle.},

Existing tools are often designed for implementation by health professionals rather than insurer case managers who may not have a background in health. This study is a secondary analysis of a longitudinal cohort study using data collected at 2–6 months and 24 months post-RTC. Participants were claimants (n = 254; Mean age = 50 years; 65\% female) with mild-moderate injuries recruited through the common-law ‘fault-based’ compulsory third party scheme in Queensland, Australia. Sociodemographic, functional and psychological health factors were collected at baseline (2–6 months post RTC) and used as potential predictors for physical and mental health-related quality of life (Short Form 36 v2) at the 2-year follow-up. The LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) analysis identified six disability items (from the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2) to predict poor physical and one item to predict poor mental health-related quality of life. Logistic regressions of these items in addition to age and gender were used to develop a screening tool. Using the tool, 90\% of those at risk of poor physical and 80\% of those at risk of poor mental health-related quality of life were identified correctly. To conclude, this study presents an 8-item, context-specific tool to help injury managers identify individuals at risk of poor physical and mental health recovery following mild-moderate RTC-related injuries. The tool requires validation in a new cohort and confirmation of acceptability by end-users.},

While current studies mainly use variants of count data regression to achieve this aim, the problem can also be considered as a binary classification task, with the dichotomous target variable indicating events (accidents) and non-events (no accidents). The effects of 45 variables – describing road condition and geometry, traffic volume and regulations, weather, and accident time – are analyzed using a dataset in high temporal (1 h) and spatial (250 m) resolution, covering the whole highway network of Austria over the period of four consecutive years. A combination of synthetic minority oversampling and maximum dissimilarity undersampling is used to balance the training dataset. We employ and compare a series of statistical learning techniques with respect to their predictive performance and discuss the importance of determining factors of accident occurrence from the ensemble of models. Findings substantiate that a trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity is inherent to imbalanced classification problems.

focus, further work should be targeted at a more detailed assessment of
the results from a traffic-safety point of view. Therefore, next steps
should focus on investigating whose sections’ outcome is captured well,
and shed some light on the why. In addition, further analysis featuring
variants of bootstrap aggregating could be useful for improving the
robustness of the results. We propose several concrete analysis steps for
this empirical assessment:
Further temporal aggregation: Given the assumption that results
obtained from any learners applied to the dataset featuring hourly
values are subject to uncertainty, the temporal binning size could be
adjusted in order to create coarser, yet more robust aggregates.
These aggregated data could be used to test the hypothesis that the
significance of results would increase with increasing binning level.
While some information is lost, since variables related to some sort
of timestamp (i.e. hour and weekday classification, respectively)
have to be dropped, a more robust assessment might prove to be
conclusive.
Assessing model performance using a meta variable: In order to
further investigate contributing factors to model quality, several
approaches featuring a new binary meta target variable, which is
derived from the confusion matrices of the existing model results,
could be tested. Multiple definitions of how to derive such a metavariable
are possible. Machine learning models for binary classification
could again be trained to assess variable importance for this
new meta model.
Balanced bagging: Following the line of Wallace et al. (2011),
bagging an ensemble of classifiers induced over balanced bootstrap
training samples and predicting the outcome state by using a majority
vote could be a valuable approach to obtain more robust results.
Correlation issues: Further insights might be gained by considering
collinearity in variables and (spatio-temporal) autocorrelation effects.
Unobserved heterogeneity: Since it is impossible to include all the
data that could potentially determine the likelihood of a traffic accident
into a statistical model, future work might focus on model
formulations accounting for unobserved heterogeneity (Mannering,
2018).
Knowledge-extraction and expert assessment: Tools for further
assessment of black-box models, including – among others – Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations [LIME, Ribeiro et al.
(2016)] and Descriptive mAchine Learning EXplanations [DALEX,
Biecek (2018)] could be used for an in-depth assessment of model
quality. In addition, the case-specific random forests (Xu et al.,
2016), which are tailored to specific points of interest in the regressor
space, could be employed to specifically assess certain road
sections of interest.
In addition, a comparison with similar analysis conducted in other
countries might provide substantial further insights into the applicability
of the proposed methodology.

The traffic resilience theory is introduced to learn safety problems from the standpoint of 1) considering safety critical events, such as traffic violations, as the safety disturbances, and 2) considering safety resilience as the ability of the traffic, greatly associated with traffic conditions, to resist critical events turning into crashes. The concept of safety resilience was illustrated qualitatively through simulation experiments. Aimsun microsimulation software was used to simulate traffic conditions with safety critical events (vehicle violations, in this paper) involved based on the geometric design of the G15 Expressway in Shanghai. Based on data from the simulation experiment, a two-staged model was developed which classifies crash risk status into three types including no-risk, low-risk and high-risk status. Modeling approach that relies on the back propagation neural network method was applied. The performance of the model in prediction was validated through the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve test. Results indicated that the model performed well in predicting crash risks in the simulated environment. After training the model, an extra simulation experiment involving six additional tests was conducted. Results show that the traffic resilience theory may work in explaining the relationship between traffic conditions, safety critical events and crash risk, which are the key elements in road safety field. The introduction of safety resilience may inspire further exploration on this topic in both research and practice. Meanwhile, the model can be used to predict and monitor risks on expressways in a potentially more precise way.},

performed using the simulation software. In addition, environments
with other types of moving violations will be further investigated with
developments in simulation tools. Despite rear-end collisions are the
most common type of crashes on expressways, other collision types
need to be considered in future work. As being promising in crash
prediction, the approach using machine learning techniques in crash
risk analysis will be further explored with different advanced machine
learning methods applied and tested. The safety resilience of traffic will
be deeper explored both theoretically and practically. Finding proper
methods to quantify and identify indicators to explain the safety resilience

abstract = {Mixed-flow intersections are prevailing in many developing countries such as China and India. At mixed-flow intersections, there is no clear lane discipline or regular trajectories within the intersection, especially for the non-motorized traffic. This leads to more interactions and encounters between the motorized traffic and the non-motorized traffic. Hence, critical instantaneous decision events such as abrupt accelerating, decelerating, jerking, swerving, and swinging, may occur more frequently, which result in potential traffic conflicts and crashes. This study presents a methodology to identify critical instantaneous decision events at the mixed-flow signalized intersections, based on the entropy theory and high-resolution vehicle trajectory data. A three-dimensional cube searching algorithm is firstly proposed to extract general traffic events by examining the proximity between trajectories. A novel model incorporating vehicle kinematics and Permutation Entropy is then developed to identify critical events, by quantifying driving volatility based on the time-serial trajectory data. Next, 3, 349 vehicle trajectories and 805 bicycle trajectories with a resolution of 0.12 s collected at a signalized intersection in Shanghai are used to demonstrate the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method is capable of identifying critical instantaneous decision events, and tends to produce a higher identification ratio comparing with the conventional method solely based on kinematic thresholds. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to investigate the effects of model parameters on the performance of the proposed method. The presented work could be applied for traffic safety assessment, real-time driving alert systems, and early diagnosis of risk-prone road users at mixed-flow intersections.},

The following five types of data were collected: crash data, large-scale taxi GPS data, road network attributes, land use features and social-demographic data. A data-driven modeling approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was proposed for discovering hidden trip patterns from a taxi GPS dataset, and a total of fifty trip patterns were identified. The collected data and the identified trip patterns were further aggregated into167 ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA). Random forest technique was used to identify the factors that contributed to total, PDO and fatal-plus-injury crashes in the selected ZCTAs during the study period. Geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) models were then developed to establish a relationship between the crashes and the contributing factors selected by the random forest technique. Comparative analyses were conducted to compare the performance of the GWPR models that considered traditional traffic exposure variables only, trip pattern variables only, and both traditional exposure and trip pattern variables. The model specification results suggest that the trip pattern variables significantly affected the crash counts in the selected ZCTAs, and the models that considered both the traditional traffic exposure and the trip pattern variables had the best goodness-of-fit in terms of the lowest MAD and AICc values.},

abstract = {Discretionary lane-changing (DLC) is one of the complex driving manoeuvres that requires surrounding traffic information for efficient and safe manoeuvring. The connected environment not only provides such information but also increases situational awareness, which is useful for DLC decision-making. However, the literature is devoid of any concrete evidence of such impact of the connected environment on DLC decision-making. As such, this paper analyses the effects of the connected environment on DLC behaviour. Seventy-eight participants from a diverse background performed DLCs in randomised driving conditions using the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator. These driving conditions are: baseline (without driving messages), connected environment with perfect communication (fully functioning and uninterrupted supply of driving messages), and connected environment with communication delay (impaired communication). Various key driving behaviour indicators are analysed and compared using a linear mixed model. To analyse the effects of the connected environment on DLC decision-making, two Generalised Estimation Equation (GEE) models are developed for gap acceptance and DLC duration. In addition, a Weibull accelerated failure time hazard-based duration model is developed to investigate the impact of the connected environment on safety associated with DLC manoeuvres. We find that drivers in the connected environment have a larger spacing, larger lead and lag gaps, a longer DLC duration, and a lower acceleration noise compared to the baseline condition. The GEE model on gap acceptance reveals that drivers tend to select relatively bigger gap sizes when the connected environment offers them the subsequent gap information. Similarly, the GEE model for DLC duration suggests that the connected environment increases DLC durations by 2.22 s and 2.11 s in perfect communication and communication delay driving conditions, respectively. Finally, the hazard-based duration model provides insights into the probability of avoiding a lane-changing collision, and indicates that the probability of a lane-changing collision is less in the connected environment driving conditions than in the baseline scenario. Overall, the connected environment improves the DLC driving behaviour and enhances traffic safety.},

abstract = {The morning commute home is an especially vulnerable time for workers engaged in night shift work due to the heightened risk of experiencing drowsy driving. One strategy to manage this risk is to monitor the driver’s state in real time using an in vehicle monitoring system and to alert drivers when they are becoming sleepy. The primary objective of this study is to build and evaluate predictive models for drowsiness events occurring in morning drives using a variety of physiological and performance data gathered under a real driving scenario. We used data collected from 16 night shift workers who drove an instrumented vehicle for approximately two hours on a test track on two occasions: after a night shift and after a night of rest. Drowsiness was defined by two outcome events: performance degradation (Lane-Crossing models) and electroencephalogram (EEG) characterized sleep episodes (Microsleep Models). For each outcome, we assessed the accuracy of sets of predictors, including or not including a driver factor, eyelid measures, and driving performance measures. We also compared the predictions using different time intervals relative to the events (e.g., 1-min prior to the event through 10-min prior). By examining the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the predictive models, the results showed that the inclusion of an individual driver factor improved AUC and prediction accuracy for both outcomes. Eyelid measures improved the prediction for the Lane-Crossing models, but not for Microsleep models. Prediction performance was not changed by adding driving performance predictors or by increasing the time to the event for either outcome. The best models for both measures of drowsiness were those considering driver individual differences and eyelid measures, suggesting that these indicators should be strongly considered when predicting drowsiness events. The results of this paper can benefit the development of real-time drowsiness detection and help to manage drowsiness to avoid related motor-vehicle crashes and loss.},

Traffic analysis zones are chosen as the analytical unit. The effects of various factors on pedestrian crash frequency investigated include characteristics the of road network, street elements, land use patterns, and traffic demand. Density and the degree of mixed land use have major effects on pedestrian crash frequency, accounting for approximately 66\% of the effects in total. More importantly, some factors show clear non-linear relationships with pedestrian crash frequency, challenging the linearity assumption commonly used in existing studies which employ statistical models. With various accurately identified non-linear relationships between the built environment and pedestrian crashes, this study suggests local agencies to adopt geo-spatial differentiated policies to establish a safe walking environment. These findings, especially the effective ranges of the built environment, provide evidence to support for transport and land use planning, policy recommendations, and road safety programs.},

One of the challenges for CAVs is that human drivers do not communicate their decisions well. Fortunately, the kinematic behavior of a human-driven vehicle may be a good predictor of driver intent within a short time frame. We analyzed the kinematic time series data (e.g., speed) for a set of drivers making left turns at intersections to predict whether the driver would stop before executing the turn. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to generate independent dimensions that explain the variation in vehicle speed before a turn. These dimensions remained relatively consistent throughout the maneuver, allowing us to compute independent scores on these dimensions for different time windows throughout the approach to the intersection. We then linked these PCA scores to whether a driver would stop before executing a left turn using the random intercept Bayesian additive regression trees. Five more road and observable vehicle characteristics were included to enhance prediction. Our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 at 94m away from the center of an intersection and steadily increased to 0.90 by 46m away from the center of an intersection.},

abstract = {This study designs a framework of feature extraction and selection, to assess vehicle driving and predict risk levels. The framework integrates learning-based feature selection, unsupervised risk rating, and imbalanced data resampling. For each vehicle, about 1300 driving behaviour features are extracted from trajectory data, which produce in-depth and multi-view measures on behaviours. To estimate the risk potentials of vehicles in driving, unsupervised data labelling is proposed. Based on extracted risk indicator features, vehicles are clustered into various groups labelled with graded risk levels. Data under-sampling of the safe group is performed to reduce the risk-safe class imbalance. Afterwards, the linkages between behaviour features and corresponding risk levels are built using XGBoost, and key features are identified according to feature importance ranking and recursive elimination. The risk levels of vehicles in driving are predicted based on key features selected. As a case study, NGSIM trajectory data are used in which four risk levels are clustered by Fuzzy C-means, 64 key behaviour features are identified, and an overall accuracy of 89\% is achieved for behaviour-based risk prediction. Findings show that this approach is effective and reliable to identify important features for driving assessment, and achieve an accurate prediction of risk levels.},

abstract = {Advanced driver assistance systems like (forward) collision warnings can increase traffic safety. As safety-critical situations (especially in urban traffic) can be diverse, integrated adaptive systems (such as multi-stage warnings) need to be developed and examined in a variety of use cases over time instead of the more common approach of testing only one-time effectiveness in the most relevant use case. Thus, this driving simulator experiment investigated a multi-stage collision warning in partially repetitive trials (T) of various safety-critical situations (scenarios confronting drivers with hazards in form of pedestrians, obstacles or preceding vehicles). Its output adapted according to the drivers’ behavior in two warning stages (W1 – warning for moderate deceleration in less critical situations; W2 – urgent warning for strong, fast braking in more critical situations). To analyze how much drivers benefit from the assistance when allowed practice with it, the driving behavior and subjective ratings of 24 participants were measured over four trials. They comprised a baseline without assistance (T1) and three further trials with assistance – a learning phase repeating the scenarios from T1 twice (T2 + T3) and a concluding transfer drive with new scenarios (T4). As expected, the situation criticality in the urgent warning (W2) scenarios was rated higher than in the warning (W1) scenarios. While the brake reaction time differed more between the W1 scenarios, the applied brake force differed more between the W2 scenarios. However, the scenario factor often interacted with the trial factor. Since in later warning stages reaction time reductions become finite, the reaction strength gains importance. Overall the drivers benefited from the assistance. Both warning stages led to faster brake reactions (of similar strength) in all three assisted trials compared to the baseline, which additionally improved successively over time (T1–T3, T1 vs. T4, T2 vs. T4). Moreover, the drivers applied the gained knowledge from the learning phase to various new situations (transfer: faster brake reactions in T4 compared to T1 or T2). The well accepted and positively rated (helpful and understandable) two-stage collision warning can thus be recommended as it facilitates accident mitigation by earlier decelerations. Practice with advanced driver assistance systems (even in driving simulators) should be endorsed to maximize their benefits for traffic safety and accident prevention.},

addendum = {The paper proposes an innovative approach to extracting useful
information about commercial truck driver behavior from widely
available big data sources. This study used eleven months of digital
tachograph data that comprised 4373 trips made by 70 truck drivers in
Japan. Results suggest that 40\% of truck drivers exhibit substantially
dangerous driving tendencies. The explanatory variables introduced in
this study accurately expressed the influence of unobserved conditions
and phenomena for potential extremely dangerous truck drivers,
especially in comparison with other types of truck drivers.
Although many factors may affect driving behavior, because of data
constraints, truck drivers’ personal attributes (e.g., age, gender, education)
and psychological conditions (e.g., upset, tired, angry) were
ignored, and GPS data in this research was only used for extracting OD
information. Furthermore, although the intuitive aspects of multilevel
modeling are appealing, many challenges remain to its practical application
and interpretation. Despite these limitations, this paper provides
a systematic approach to identifying potential risks among
different truck drivers that considers both macro and micro perspectives.
We suggest that future work focus on the following four aspects.
First, big data should be integrated with questionnaire survey data
about truck drivers’ personal characteristics and psychological factors.
Second, more spatial information could be derived from GPS data.
Third, effective data fusion approaches should be developed to support
the above data integration and maximize statistical and epidemiological
methods, deep learning techniques, and behavioral models.
Finally, the above efforts should be extrapolated to implement practical
safety improvements by developing effective decision support systems.}

abstract = {Recently, technologies for predicting traffic conflicts in real-time have been gaining momentum due to their proactive nature of application and the growing implementation of ADAS technology in intelligent vehicles. In ADAS, machine learning classifiers are utilised to predict potential traffic conflicts by analysing data from in-vehicle sensors. In most cases, a condition is classified as a traffic conflict when a safety surrogate (e.g. time-to-collision, TTC) crosses a pre-defined threshold. This approach, however, largely ignores other factors that influence traffic conflicts such as speed variance, traffic density, speed and weather conditions. Considering all these factors in detecting traffic conflicts is rather complex as it requires an integration and mining of heterodox data, the unavailability of traffic conflicts and conflict prediction models capable of extracting meaningful and accurate information in a timely manner. In addition, the model has to effectively handle large imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a centralised digital architecture and employs a Deep Learning methodology to predict traffic conflicts. Highly disaggregated traffic data and in-vehicle sensors data from an instrumented vehicle are collected from a section of the UK M1 motorway to build the model. Traffic conflicts are identified by a Regional–Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) model which detects lane markings and tracks vehicles from images captured by a single front-facing camera. This data is then integrated with traffic variables and calculated safety surrogate measures (SSMs) via a centralised digital architecture to develop a series of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to predict these traffic conflicts. The results indicate that TTC, as expected, varies by speed, weather and traffic density and the best DNN model provides an accuracy of 94\% making it reliable to employ in ADAS technology as proactive safety management strategies. Furthermore, by exchanging this traffic conflict awareness data, connected vehicles (CVs) can mitigate the risk of traffic collisions.},

The dataset used in this study contains 297,113 vehicle crashes, obtained from the Michigan Traffic Crash Facts (MTCF) dataset, from 2016–2017. Similar to any other crash dataset, different accident severity classes are not equally represented in MTCF. To account for the imbalanced classes, several techniques have been used, including under-sampling and over-sampling. Using five classification learning models (i.e., Logistic regression, Decision tree, Neural network, Gradient boosting model, and Naïve Bayes classifier), we classify the levels of injury severity and attempt to improve the classification performance by two training-testing methods including Bootstrap aggregation (or bagging) and majority voting. Furthermore, due to the imbalance present in the dataset, we use the geometric mean (G-mean) to evaluate the classification performance. We show that the classification performance is the highest when bagging is used with decision trees, with over-sampling treatment for imbalanced data. The effect of treatments for the imbalanced data is maximized when under-sampling is combined with bagging. In addition to the original five classes of injury severity in the MTCF dataset, we consider two additional classification problems, one with two classes and the other with three classes, to (1) investigate the impact of the number of classes on the performance of classification models, and (2) enable comparing our results with the literature.},

As long as the automated vehicle technology has not achieved full automation (Level 5), human drivers are still expected to take over the steering wheel and throttles when there is an automated vehicle disengagement. However, contributing factors and the mechanism about automated vehicle-initiated disengagement has not been quantitatively and comprehensively explored and investigated due to the lack of field test data. Besides, understanding human drivers’ perception and promptness of reaction to the AV disengagement is essential to ensure safety transition between automated and manual driving. By harnessing California’s Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement Report Database, which includes the AV disengagement data from field tests in 2016–2017, this paper quantitatively investigated the AV disengagement using multiple statistical modeling approaches that involve statistical modeling and classification tree. Specifically, the paper identifies the contributing factors impacting human drivers’ promptness to AV disengagements, and quantitatively investigates the underlying causes to AV disengagements. Results indicate that current AV disengagement on public roads is dominated by causes due to a planning issue. The cause of an AV disengagement is significantly induced by lacking certain numbers of radar and LiDAR sensors installed on the automated vehicles. These thresholds of these sensors needed are revealed. Cause of disengagement and roadway characteristics significantly impact drivers’ take-over time when facing an AV disengagement. AV perception or control issue-based disengagement can significantly extend drivers’ perception-reaction time to take over the driving. The quantitative knowledge obtained ultimately facilitates revealing the mechanisms of the automated vehicle disengagements to ensure safe AV operations on public roads.},

Existing studies have made great efforts to explore the underlying mechanisms of SCs and relevant methodologies have been evolving over the last two decades concerning the identification, modeling, and prevention of these crashes. So far there is a lack of a detailed examination on the progress, lessons, and potential opportunities regarding existing achievements in SC-related studies. This paper provides a comprehensive investigation of the state-of-the-art approaches; examines their strengths and weaknesses; and provides guidance in exploiting new directions in SC-related research. It aims to support researchers and practitioners in understanding well-established approaches so as to further explore the frontiers. Published studies focused on SCs since 1997 have been identified, reviewed, and summarized. Key issues concentrated on the following aspects are discussed: (i) static/dynamic approaches to identify SCs; (ii) parametric/non-parametric models to analyze SC risk, and (iii) deployable countermeasures to prevent SCs. Based on the examined issues, needs, and challenges, this paper further provides insights into potential opportunities such as: (a) fusing data from multiple sources for SC identification, (b) using advanced learning algorithms for real-time SC analysis, and (c) deploying connected vehicles for SC prevention in future research.

Nationwide, from 2014 to 2016, annual RwD crashes accounted for 53\% of all motor vehicle traffic fatalities. Several factors may cause a driver leave the travel lane, including an avoidance maneuver and inattention or fatigue. Roadway and roadside geometric design features (e.g., lane widths and clear zones) play a significant role in whether human error results in a crash. In this paper, we present a hazard-based duration model to investigate the distance traveled by an errant vehicle in a run-off-road crash, the stopping hazard rates, and associated risk factors. For this study, we obtained five years' (2010–2014) of crash data related to roadway departures (i.e., overturn and fixed-object crashes) from the Federal Highway Administration's Highway Safety Information System Database. The results indicate that over 50\% of the observed vehicles traveled no more than 36 ft. in a ROR crash and 25\% of the observed vehicles traveled at least 78 ft. We also found that seasonal, roadway, and crash variables, along with vehicle information and driver characteristics significantly contributed to the distances traveled by errant vehicles in ROR crashes. This paper presents methodological empirical evidence that the Cox proportional-hazards model is appropriate for investigating the distances traveled by errant vehicles in ROR crashes. In addition, it also provides valuable information for traffic design and management agencies to improve roadside design policies and implementing appropriately forgiving roadsides for errant vehicles.},

An understanding of the contributing factors and their significant association with rear-end crashes is of practical importance and will help in the development of effective countermeasures. The objective of this study is to assess rear-end crash potential at a microscopic level in an urban environment, by investigating vehicle-by-vehicle interactions. To do so, several traffic parameters at the individual vehicle level have been taken into consideration, for capturing car-following characteristics and vehicle interactions, and to investigate their effect on potential rear-end crashes. In this study rear-end crash potential was estimated based on stopping distance between two consecutive vehicles, and four rear-end crash potential cases were developed. The results indicated that 66.4\% of the observations were estimated as rear-end crash potentials. It was also shown that rear-end crash potential was presented when traffic flow and speed standard deviation were higher. Also, locational characteristics such as lane of travel and location in the network were found to affect drivers’ car following decisions and additionally, it was shown that speeds were lower and headways higher when Heavy Goods Vehicles lead. Finally, a model-based behavioral analysis based on Multinomial Logit regression was conducted to systematically identify the statistically significant variables in explaining rear-end risk potential. The modeling results highlighted the significance of the explanatory variables associated with rear-end crash potential, however it was shown that their effect varied among different model configurations. The outcome of the results can be of significant value for several purposes, such as real-time monitoring of risk potential, allocating enforcement units in urban networks and designing targeted proactive safety policies.},

abstract = {Traffic crash detection is a major component of intelligent transportation systems. It can explore inner relationships between traffic conditions and crash risk, prevent potential crashes, and improve road safety. However, there exist some limitations in current studies on crash detection: (1) The commonly used machine learning methods cannot simulate the evolving transitions of traffic conditions before crash occurrences; (2) Current models collected traffic data of only one temporal resolution, which cannot fully represent traffic trends in different time intervals. Therefore, this study proposes a Long short-term memory (LSTM) based framework considering traffic data of different temporal resolutions (LSTMDTR) for crash detection. LSTM is an effective deep learning method to capture the long-term dependency and dynamic transitions of pre-crash conditions. Three LSTM networks considering traffic data of different temporal resolutions are constructed, which can comprehensively indicate traffic variations in different time intervals. A fully-connected layer is used to combine the outputs of three LSTM networks, and a dropout layer is used to reduce overfitting and improve prediction performance. The LSTMDTR model is implemented on datasets of I880-N and I805-N in California, America. The results indicate that the LSTMDTR model can obtain satisfactory performance on crash detection, with the highest crash accuracy of 70.43 \%. LSTMDTR models constructed on one freeway can be transferred to other similar freeways, with 65.12 \% of crash accuracy on transferability. Compared with machine learning methods and LSTM models with one or two temporal resolutions, the LSTMDTR model has been validated to perform better on crash detection and transferability. A proper number of neurons in the LSTMDTR model should be determined in real applications considering acceptable detection performance and computation time. The dropout technique can reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the LSTMDTR model, increasing crash accuracy from 64.49 \% to 70.43 \%.},

The Poisson-Tweedie distribution offers a unified framework to model overdispersed, underdispersed, zero-inflated, spatial, and longitudinal count data, as well as multiple response variables of similar or mixed types. The form of its variance function is simple, and can be specified as the mean added to the product of dispersion and mean raised to the power P. The flexibility of the Poisson-Tweedie distribution lies in the domain of P, which includes positive real number values. Special cases of the Poisson-Tweedie distribution models include the linear form of the negative binomial (NB1) model with P equal to 1.0, the geometric Poisson (GeoP) model with P equal to 1.5, the quadratic form of the negative binomial (NB2) model with P equal to 2.0, and the Poisson Inverse Gaussian (PIG) model with P equal to 3.0. A series of models were developed in this study using the Poisson-Tweedie distribution without any restrictions on the value of the power parameter as well as with specific values of the power parameter representing NB1, GeoP, NB2, and PIG models. The effects of fixed and varying dispersion parameters (i.e., dispersion as a function of covariates) on the variance and expected crash frequency estimates were also examined. Three years (2012–2014) of crash data from urban three-leg stop-controlled intersections and urban four-leg signalized intersections in the state of Florida were used to develop the models. The Poisson-Tweedie models or the GeoP models were found to perform better when the dispersion parameter was constant or fixed. With the varying dispersion parameter, the NB2 and PIG models were found to perform better, with both performing equally well. Also, the fixed dispersion parameter values were found to be smaller in the models with a higher value of the power parameter. The variation across the models in their estimates of weight factor, expected crash frequency, and potential for safety improvement of hazardous sites based on the empirical Bayes method was also discussed.},

There were no significant differences in proportion of intervention and control participants who had microsleeps (p ≤ .096), stopped driving due to sleepiness (p = .107), recorded objective episodes of drowsiness (p = .455), and crashed (p = .761), although there was a trend towards more control participants having microsleeps and stopping driving. Those in the intervention group reported higher subjective sleepiness at the end of the drive [M = 6.25, SD = 3.83, t(31) = 2.15, p = .05] and were more likely to indicate that they would stop driving [M = 3.08, SD = 1.16, t(31) = 2.24, p = .04]. The education program improved some aspects of driver knowledge about sleep and safety. The results also suggested that the education program lead to an increased awareness of sleepiness. Education about sleep and driving could reduce the risk of drowsy driving and associated road trauma in young drivers, but requires evaluation in a broader sample with assessment of real world driving outcomes.},

abstract = {Learning from past accidents is fundamental to accident prevention. Thus, accident and near miss reporting are encouraged by organizations and regulators. However, for organizations managing large safety databases, the time taken to accurately classify accident and near miss narratives will be very significant. This study aims to evaluate the utility of various text mining classification techniques in classifying 1000 publicly available construction accident narratives obtained from the US OSHA website. The study evaluated six machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB), and found that SVM produced the best performance in classifying the test set of 251 cases. Further experimentation with tokenization of the processed text and non-linear SVM were also conducted. In addition, a grid search was conducted on the hyperparameters of the SVM models. It was found that the best performing classifiers were linear SVM with unigram tokenization and radial basis function (RBF) SVM with uni-gram tokenization. In view of its relative simplicity, the linear SVM is recommended. Across the 11 labels of accident causes or types, the precision of the linear SVM ranged from 0.5 to 1, recall ranged from 0.36 to 0.9 and F1 score was between 0.45 and 0.92. The reasons for misclassification were discussed and suggestions on ways to improve the performance were provided.},

abstract = {Safety analysts usually use post-modeling methods, such as the Goodness-of-Fit statistics or the Likelihood Ratio Test, to decide between two or more competitive distributions or models. Such metrics require all competitive distributions to be fitted to the data before any comparisons can be accomplished. Given the continuous growth in introducing new statistical distributions, choosing the best one using such post-modeling methods is not a trivial task, in addition to all theoretical or numerical issues the analyst may face during the analysis. Furthermore, and most importantly, these measures or tests do not provide any intuitions into why a specific distribution (or model) is preferred over another (Goodness-of-Logic). This paper ponders into these issues by proposing a methodology to design heuristics for Model Selection based on the characteristics of data, in terms of descriptive summary statistics, before fitting the models. The proposed methodology employs two analytic tools: (1) Monte-Carlo Simulations and (2) Machine Learning Classifiers, to design easy heuristics to predict the label of the ‘most-likely-true’ distribution for analyzing data. The proposed methodology was applied to investigate when the recently introduced Negative Binomial Lindley (NB-L) distribution is preferred over the Negative Binomial (NB) distribution. Heuristics were designed to select the ‘most-likely-true’ distribution between these two distributions, given a set of prescribed summary statistics of data. The proposed heuristics were successfully compared against classical tests for several real or observed datasets. Not only they are easy to use and do not need any post-modeling inputs, but also, using these heuristics, the analyst can attain useful information about why the NB-L is preferred over the NB - or vice versa- when modeling data.},

As such, the objective of this research is to provide a spatiotemporal comparative investigation of the crashes involving these aging roadway users in Florida via concurrently using the same set of predictors in order to obtain comparable findings among them. First, a new metric, namely Crash Rate Difference (CRD) approach is developed, which enables one to capture potential spatial and temporal (e.g., weekend and weekday) variations in crash rates of aging user-involved crashes. Second, a multivariate random parameter Tobit model is utilized to determine the factors that drive both the crash occurrence probability and the crash rate of 65+ roadway users, accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity. Findings show that there are statistically significant heterogeneous effects of predictors on the crash rates of different roadway users, which evidences the unobserved heterogeneity across observations. Results also indicate that the presence of facilities such as hospitals, religious facilities, or supermarkets is very influential on crash rates of 65+ roadway users, advocating that roadways around these facilities should be particularly scrutinized by road safety stakeholders. Interestingly, the effect of these facilities on crashes also differs significantly between weekdays and weekends. Moreover, the roadway segments with high crash rates vary temporally depending on whether it is a weekday or a weekend. These findings regarding the spatiotemporal variations clearly indicate the need to develop and design better traffic safety measures and plans addressing these specific roadway segments, which can be tailored to alleviate traffic safety problems for 65+ roadway users.},

Subsequently, with the TRA cognitive factors as the input attributes, six widely-used machine learning algorithms and logistic regression were used to develop models to predict \% unsafe behavior. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves show that decision tree provides the best prediction. It was found that intention and social norms have the biggest influence on whether a worker was observed to work safely or not. Thus, managers aiming to improve safety behaviors need to pay specific attention to social norms in the worksite. The study also showed that a TRA survey can be used to extend a BBS to facilitate more effective interventions.

abstract = {Background
Until the level of full vehicle automation is reached, users of vehicle automation systems will be required to take over manual control of the vehicle occasionally and stay fallback-ready to some extent during the drive. Both, drowsiness caused by inactivity and the engagement in distracting non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) such as entertainment or office work have been suggested to impair the driver’s ability to safely handle these transitions of control. Thus, it is an open question whether engagement in NDRTs will impair or improve take-over performance.
Method
In a motion-based driving simulator, 64 participants completed an automated drive that lasted either one or two hours using either a partially or highly automated driving system. In the partially automated driving condition, a warning was issued after several seconds when drivers took both hands off the steering wheel, while the highly automated driving system allowed hands-off driving permanently. Drivers were allowed to bring along their smartphones and to use them during the drive. They engaged in a wide variety of NDRTs such as reading or using social media. At the end of the session, drivers had to react to a sudden lead vehicle braking event. In the partial automation condition, there was no take-over request (TOR) to notify the drivers of the braking vehicle, while in the highly automated condition, the situation happened right after the drivers had deactivated the automation in response to a TOR. The lead time of the TOR was set at 8 s. Driver’s level of drowsiness, workload (visual, mental and motoric) from carrying out the NDRT and motivational appeal of the NDRT right before the control transition were video-coded and used to predict the outcome of the braking event (i.e., reaction and system deactivation times, minimal Time-to-collision (TTC) and self-reported criticality) with a multiple regression approach.
Results
In the partial automation condition, reaction times to the braking vehicle and situation criticality as measured by the minimum TTC could be well predicted. Main predictors for increased reaction time were drowsiness and motivational appeal of the NDRT. However, visual and mental demand associated with NDRTs did decrease reaction time, suggesting that the NDRT helped the drivers to maintain alertness during the partially automated drive. Accordingly, drowsiness and motivational appeal of the NDRT increased situation criticality, while cognitive load due to the NDRT decreased it. In the highly automated condition, however, it was not possible to predict system deactivation time (in reaction to the TOR), brake reaction time to the braking vehicle and situation criticality by observed drowsiness and NDRT engagement.
Discussion
The results suggest a relationship between the driver’s drowsiness and NDRT engagement in partial automation but not in highly automated driving. Several explanations for this finding are discussed. It could be possible that the lead time of 8 s might have given the drivers enough time to complete the driver state transition process from executing NDRTs to manual driving, putting them in a position to be able to cope with the driving event, while this was not possible in the partial automation condition. Methodological issues that might have led to a non-detection of an effect of drowsiness or NDRT engagement in the highly automated driving condition, such as the sample size and sensitivity of the observer ratings, are also discussed.},

abstract = {Introduction
This study examines the relationship between two variables–mindfulness and income–with regards to their relationship to the use of smartphones by young drivers, which has been known to increase the likelihood of car accidents, endangering young drivers and other road users. The study focuses on the relationship between these variables and the use of smartphones while driving, and how this relationship differs between males and females.
Method
The study sample included 221 young drivers who were legally permitted to drive without supervision. The subjects were first asked to complete questionnaires on mindfulness and income. Next, their smartphone use while driving was monitored over a one-month period. This study is unique as it used an objective smartphone monitoring application (rather than self-reporting) to count the number of times the young participants actually touched their smartphones while driving.
Results
The findings show that the effects of social and personal factors (i.e., income and mindfulness) on the use of smartphones while driving are significant for males but not for females.
Conclusions
Most studies that investigate differences between males and females with respect to safety focus on differences in the averages of safety-related variables (such as safety performance and outcomes). In the current study, however, we identified differences in relationships between variables and demonstrated that what predicts safety-related behavior in males may not be a good predictor for females.
Practical applications
Mindfulness and income can be used to identify male populations that are at risk of using smartphones while driving. Interventions that improve mindfulness can be used to reduce the use of smartphones by male drivers.},

This paper proposes a new modular design approach for the early detection of driver fatigue system taking into account optimisation of system performance using particle swarm optimisation (PSO). The proposed system is designed and implemented using an existing dataset that was simultaneously collected from participants and vehicles in a naturalistic environment. Four types of data are considered as fatigue-related metrics including: vehicle acceleration, vehicle rotation pattern, driver's head position and driver's head rotation. The driver's blink rate data is used in this work as a proxy for ground truth for the classification algorithm. The collected data elements are initially fed to input modules represented by ternary neural network classifiers that estimates alertness. A Bayesian algorithm with PSO is then used to combine and optimise detection performance based on the number of existing input modules as well as their output states. Performance of the developed fatigue-detection system is assessed experimentally with a small data samples of driver trips. The obtained results are found in agreement with the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy (90.4\%), sensitivity (92.6\%) and specificity (90.7\%). These results are achieved with significant design flexibility and robustness against partial loss of input data source(s). However, due to small sample size of dataset (N = 3), a larger dataset need to be tested with the same system framework to generalise the findings of this work.},

Currently, the self-driving vehicles are programmed for conservative behavior, yielding to approaching pedestrians. Consequently, the future urban traffic will slow down significantly. In this paper, a conceptual model of vehicle–pedestrian negotiation is proposed. This model allows individual decision making of multiple vehicles and pedestrians, extending a prior negotiation model for a single vehicle and a single pedestrian. The possible negotiation opportunities for vehicles are modeled considering different risk-taking behaviors of pedestrians. Simulation results show an overall improvement in the waiting time of vehicles and thus in the intersection throughput, compared to conservative vehicle behavior. The simulation results show also that the benefit of reduced waiting times for vehicles comes at the cost of some waiting time for pedestrians. However, the observed pedestrian waiting times in this model are not more than the generally accepted waiting times reported in empirical studies.},

abstract = {Mobile phone distracted driving is a recurrent issue in road safety worldwide. Recent research on driving behaviour of distracted drivers suggests that in certain circumstances drivers seem to assume safer behaviours while using a mobile phone. Despite a high volume of research on this topic, self-regulation by mobile phone distracted drivers is not well understood as many driving simulator experiments are designed to impose an equal level of distraction to participants being tested for their driving performance. The aim of this research was to investigate the relationship between self-regulatory secondary task performance and driving. By a driving simulator experiment in which participants were allowed to perform their secondary tasks whenever they feel appropriate, the driving performance of 35 drivers aged 18–29 years was observed under three phone conditions including non-distraction (no phone use), hands-free interactions and visual-manual interactions in the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator. Drivers’ longitudinal and lateral vehicle control observed across various road traffic conditions were then modelled by Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) with exchangeable correlation structure accounting for heterogeneity resulting from multiple observations from the same driver. Results show that the extent of engagement in the secondary task influence both longitudinal and lateral control of vehicles. Drivers who engaged in a large number of hands-free interactions are found to select lower driving speed. In contrast, longer visual-manual interactions are found to result in higher driving speed among drivers self-regulating their secondary task. Among the road traffic conditions, drivers distracted by their self-regulated secondary tasks are found to select lower speeds along the s-curve compared to straight and motorway segments. In summary, the applied human-machine system approach suggests that road traffic demands play a vital role in both secondary task management and driving performance.},

Understanding the causes that give rise to different types of conflict events, as well as their characteristics, can help researchers and traffic authorities to draw up strategies aimed at mitigating collision risks. This paper proposes a framework for grouping traffic conflicts relying on similar profiles and factors that contribute to conflict occurrence using self-organizing maps (SOM). In order to improve the quality of the formed groups, we developed a novel variable importance index relying on the outputs of the nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) that intends to identify the most informative variables for grouping collision events. Such index guides a backward variable selection procedure in which less relevant variables are removed one-by-one; after each removal, the clustering quality is assessed via the Davies-Bouldin (DB) index. The proposed framework was applied to a real-time dataset collected from a Brazilian highway aimed at allocating traffic conflicts into groups presenting similar profiles. The selected variables suggest that lower average speeds, which are typically verified during congestion events, contribute to conflict occurrence. Higher variability on speed (denoted by high standard deviation, and speed’s coefficient of variation levels on that variable), which are also perceived in the assessed freeway near to congestion periods, also contribute to conflicts.},

Specific warning information about these hazards could improve drivers’ reactions and the warning effectiveness, but could also impair them, for example, by additional cognitive-processing costs. In a driving simulator study with 88 participants, we investigated the effects of modality (auditory vs. visual) and specificity (low vs. high) on warning effectiveness. For the specific warnings, we used augmented reality as an advanced technology to display the additional auditory or visual warning information. Part one of the study concentrates on the effectiveness of necessary warnings and part two on the drivers’ compliance despite false alarms. For the first warning scenario, we found several positive main effects of specificity. However, subsequent effects of specificity were moderated by the modality of the warnings. The specific visual warnings were observed to have advantages over the three other warning designs concerning gaze and braking reaction times, passing speeds and collision rates. Besides the true alarms, braking reaction times as well as subjective evaluation after these warnings were still improved despite false alarms. The specific auditory warnings were revealed to have only a few advantages, but also several disadvantages. The results further indicate that the exact coding of additional information, beyond its mere amount and modality, plays an important role. Moreover, the observed advantages of the specific visual warnings highlight the potential benefit of augmented reality coding to improve future collision warnings.},

This paper investigates the location and time of a potential secondary accident after the occurrence of an initial traffic accident. With accident data and traffic loop data collected over three years from California interstate freeways, a shock wave-based method was introduced to identify secondary accidents. A linear regression model and two machine learning algorithms, including a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), were implemented to explore the distance and time gap between the initial and secondary accidents using inputs of crash severity, violation category, weather condition, tow away, road surface condition, lighting, parties involved, traffic volume, duration, and shock wave speed generated by the primary accident. From the results, the linear regression model was inadequate in describing the effect of most variables and its goodness-of-fit and accuracy in prediction was relatively poor. In the training programs, the BPNN and LSSVM demonstrated adequate goodness-of-fit, though the BPNN was superior with a higher CORR and lower MSE. The BPNN model also outperformed the LSSVM in time prediction, while both failed to provide adequate distance prediction. Therefore, the BPNN model could be used to forecast the time gap between initial and secondary accidents, which could be used by decision makers and incident management agencies to prevent or reduce secondary collisions.},

abstract = {Driving behavior recognition is the foundation of driver assistance systems, with potential applications in automated driving systems. Most prevailing studies have used subjective questionnaire data and objective driving data to classify driving behaviors, while few studies have used physiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) to gather data. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a two-layer learning method for driving behavior recognition using EEG data. A simulated car-following driving experiment was designed and conducted to simultaneously collect data on the driving behaviors and EEG data of drivers. The proposed learning method consists of two layers. In Layer I, two-dimensional driving behavior features representing driving style and stability were selected and extracted from raw driving behavior data using K-means and support vector machine recursive feature elimination. Five groups of driving behaviors were classified based on these two-dimensional driving behavior features. In Layer II, the classification results from Layer I were utilized as inputs to generate a k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier identifying driving behavior groups using EEG data. Using independent component analysis, a fast Fourier transformation, and linear discriminant analysis sequentially, the raw EEG signals were processed to extract two core EEG features. Classifier performance was enhanced using the adaptive synthetic sampling approach. A leave-one-subject-out cross validation was conducted. The results showed that the average classification accuracy for all tested traffic states was 69.5\% and the highest accuracy reached 83.5\%, suggesting a significant correlation between EEG patterns and car-following behavior.},

Although count models are widely used for arterial roads, their application to rural local roads is sparse, partly due to the concern of possible estimation bias caused by low crash counts. This paper revisits the matter to further evaluate the suitability of negative binomial models for rural local roads with low crash frequencies, comparing the performance of the model to probabilistic regression (ordered probit) proposed in the past. The negative binomial model was estimated to predict crashes for rural local intersections and compared to predictions obtained from the ordered probit model. Bivariate versions of both models were applied to improve model efficiency by incorporating correlation between two severity outcomes, fatal/injury (FI) and property damage only (PDO) crashes. The estimated models included several significant variables with intuitive signs. These results are discussed in the paper to support the claim that both models are adequate. Furthermore, the cumulative sums of the model-predicted and observed crashes conditioned on the estimated effects were compared to detect any systematic bias in the results. Although both models showed similar performance and no obvious biases could be detected, the negative binomial model seemed to behave slightly better than the ordered probit model, demonstrating the model’s suitability in the analyzed case. The results point to the possibility of applying the Highway Safety Manual methodology to lower-volume county roads with focus shifted from individual high-crash locations to safety-deficient road features present at multiple locations.},

While the current study focused on rural local intersections, future

abstract = {Crashes present different collision types. There usually exist unobserved risk factors which could jointly affect crash rates of different types, resulting in correlation and heterogeneity issues across observations. The primary objective of the study is to propose a novel random parameters multivariate Tobit (RPMV-Tobit) model for evaluating risk factors on crash rates of different collision types. Crash data from 367 freeway diverge areas in a three-year period were obtained for modeling. Three major types of collisions including rear-end, sideswipe, and angle collisions were considered. The RPMV-Tobit model was structured to simultaneously accommodate correlations between crash rates across collision types and unobserved heterogeneity across observations. The RPMV-Tobit model was compared with a multivariate Tobit (MV-Tobit) model, a random effect multivariate Tobit (REMV-Tobit) model, and independent univariate Tobit (IU-Tobit) models under the Bayesian framework. The results showed that MV-Tobit model outperforms the IU-Tobit models on fitting crash rates, indicating that accounting for the correlation between crash types can improve model fit. The RPMV-Tobit model and REMV-Tobit model perform better than the MV-Tobit model, suggesting that accounting for the unobserved heterogeneous can further improve model fit. The improvement of model performance with the RPMV-Tobit model is higher than that with the REMV-Tobit model. The impacts of each risk factor on crash rates were estimated and some differences were found across different collision types. The lane-balanced design, number of lanes on mainline, speed limit, and speed difference present significant heterogeneous effects on crash rates. Findings suggest that the RPMV-Tobit model is a superior approach for comprehensive crash rates modeling and traffic safety evaluation purposes.},

addendum = {The analysis suggests the considerable potential of the proposed

findings regarding collision types were obtained, there are some limitations
to this study. First, research efforts still need to be conducted
with crash data collected from other states or areas to validate the results
of this paper before the results can be used to direct the exit ramp
designs. Second, this study did not give enough insight into occurrence
mechanism for different crashes. Rear-end crashes could be related to
abrupt deceleration at diverge bottlenecks, and sideswipe/angle crashes
could be caused by intense lane changes. As such, high-resolution traffic
data from loop detectors on freeway mainlines and ramps could be
collected to develop the real time crash risk prediction models in future
study. Third, the insignificant variables that excluded in the final
models can introduce omitted variable bias, which should be considered
by optimizing the statistical modeling frameworks. There are
several areas of further research that can be investigated to improve the
current study. First, due to the limited access to the crash severity, this
paper did not incorporate injury-severity in the developed models. An
extension of the current study can examine the injury-severity rates
across collision types. This will provide new insights regarding the injury-
severity mechanism across different collision types. Second, this
study did not consider the temporal and spatial correlation in crash
rates, further study could be conducted to extend the current model to
accommodate the temporal and spatial effect. Moreover, further research
efforts could also be made to compare the risk factors with crash
frequency and that with crash rates. Last but not least, future study can
further decompose the Tobit coefficients to the effect of the parameters
on the overall rates, and on the probability of an observation being in
the zero-state. They will help with the model parameters’ inferences.

This paper proposes a novel score-based traffic law-enforcement and network management system (SLEM) that is based on connected vehicles (CV) technology. SLEM assigns a score to each driver which reflects her/his driving performance and compliance with traffic laws. The proposed system adopts a rewarding mechanism that rewards high-performing drivers and penalizes low-performing drivers who fail to obey the laws. The reward mechanism is in the form of a route guidance strategy that restricts low-score drivers from accessing certain roadway sections and time periods that are strategically selected in order to achieve an optimal traffic pattern in the network in which high-score drivers experience less congestion and a higher level of safety. A nationwide survey study was conducted to measure public acceptance of the proposed system. Another survey targeted a focused group of traffic operation and safety professionals. Based on the results of these surveys, a set of logistic regression models were developed to examine the sensitivity of public acceptance to policy and behavioral variables. The results showed that about 65.7 percent of the public and about 60.0 percent of professionals who participated in this study support the real-world implementation of SLEM.},

abstract = {Developing conditionally automated driving systems is on the rise. Vehicles with full longitudinal and latitudinal control will allow drivers to engage in secondary tasks without monitoring the roadway, but users may be required to resume vehicle control to handle critical hazards. The loss of driver’s situational awareness increases the potential for accidents. Thus, the automated systems need to estimate the driver’s ability to resume control of the driving task. The aim of this study was to assess the physiological behaviour (heart rate and pupil diameter) of drivers. The assessment was performed during two naturalistic secondary tasks. The tasks were the email and the twenty questions task in addition to a control group that did not perform any tasks. The study aimed at finding possible correlations between the driver’s physiological data and their responses to a takeover request. A driving simulator study was used to collect data from a total of 33 participants in a repeated measures design to examine the physiological changes during driving and to measure their takeover quality and response time. Secondary tasks induced changes on physiological measures and a small influence on response time. However, there was a strong observed correlation between the physiological measures and response time. Takeover quality in this study was assessed using two new performance measures called PerSpeed and PerAngle. They are identified as the mean percentage change of vehicle’s speed and heading angle starting from a take-over request time. Using linear mixed models, there was a strong interaction between task, heart rate and pupil diameter and PerSpeed, PerAngle and response time. This, in turn, provided a measurable understanding of a driver’s future responses to the automated system based on the driver’s physiological changes to allow better decision making. The present findings of this study emphasised the possibility of building a driver mental state model and prediction system to determine the quality of the driver's responses in a highly automated vehicle. Such results will reduce accidents and enhance the driver’s experience in highly automated vehicles.},

due to the limitations of the study; however, it should be considered

This study compares the performance of two popular machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), to detect the occurrence of accidents on the Eisenhower expressway in Chicago. Accordingly, since the detection of accidents should be as rapid as possible, seven models are trained and tested for each machine learning technique, using traffic condition data from 1 to 7 min after the actual occurrence. The main sources of data used in this study consist of weather condition, accident, and loop detector data. Furthermore, to overcome the problem of imbalanced data (i.e., underrepresentation of accidents in the dataset), the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is used. The results show that although SVM achieves overall higher accuracy, PNN outperforms SVM regarding the Detection Rate (DR) (i.e., percentage of correct accident detections). In addition, while both models perform best at 5 min after the occurrence of accidents, models trained at 3 or 4 min after the occurrence of an accident detect accidents more rapidly while performing reasonably well. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis of PNN for Time-To-Detection (TTD) reveals that the speed difference between upstream and downstream of accidents location is particularly significant to detect the occurrence of accidents.},

While a few past studies have examined the impact of ASCT on crash frequency, little is known about its effect on injury severity outcomes. Similarly, the impact of different types of ASCTs deployed across different states is also uncertain. This paper therefore, used ordered probit models with random parameters to estimate the injury severity outcomes resulting from ASCT deployment across Pennsylvania and Virginia. Two disparate systems deployed across the two different states were analyzed to assess whether they had similar impacts on injury severity, although signal timings are optimized using different algorithms by both systems. The estimation results revealed that both ASCT systems were associated with reductions in injury severity levels. Marginal effects showed that Type A ASCT systems reduced the propensity of severe plus moderate and minor injury crashes by 11.70\% and 10.36\% while type B ASCT reduced the propensity of severe plus moderate and minor injury crashes by 4.39\% and 6.92\%. Similarly, the ASCTs deployed across the two states were also observed to reduce injury severities. The combined best fit model also revealed a similar trend towards reductions in severe plus moderate and minor injury crashes by 5.24\% and 9.91\%. This model performed well on validation data with a low forecast error of 0.301 and was also observed to be spatially transferable. These results encourage the consideration of ASCT deployments at intersections with high crash severities and have practical implications for aiding agencies in making future deployment decisions about ASCT.},

annotation = {Not ML},
addendum = {Furthermore, the use of random parameter logit model with heterogeneity
in means and variance may help in improving the prediction
power of the severe plus moderate injury category at the cost of neglecting
the ordinal nature of severities. It may also make sense to try
machine learning algorithms such (K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier and
Random Forest) instead of discrete choice models, which could yield
better prediction power for disaggregate severity levels since they don’t
rely on making assumptions about the functional form of the data and
require fewer parameters to tune.
Since the main objective of this paper was to perform exploratory
analysis of ASCT’s impact on signalized intersection crash severity,
crash frequency and individual crash type models were not considered
in this research. Another reason was that the authors have already
developed crash modification factors for ASCT (Khattak et al., 2017a)
and considered those to be more useful to both practitioners and researchers.
However, an interesting future research direction would be
to examine how the results of crash frequency and individual crash type
models compare with the crash severities presented in this paper and
the CMFs developed by the authors. The optimization algorithms vary
across the ASCT systems and may provide differing benefits thus, future
studies could also look at crash severity effects of other ASCT systems as
opposed to the two systems analyzed in this research and draw a
comparison. Likewise, the emergence of automated traffic signal performance
measurement systems provides an additional technology that
could be compared against ASCT. With the development of connected
and automated vehicles (CAV), CAV-enabled signal controls may also
be analyzed in the future to see whether they provide any additional
safety benefits compared to the ASCT systems analyzed in this research.
Since crash trends vary across states, data from additional states across
the United States can also provide significant insights about the crash
severity effects of ASCTs. Another promising research direction could
be to analyze the different econometric models and machine learning
algorithms in order to see which modeling approach could provide
better prediction accuracy with the severe plus moderate injury category,
since that category had the lowest number of observations.}

abstract = {Recent technological advancements have facilitated the implementation of speed harmonization based on connected and automated vehicles (CAV) to prevent crashes on the road. In addition, trajectory-level vehicle controls are receiving substantial attention as sensors, wireless communications, and control systems are rapidly advancing. This study proposes a novel vehicle speed control strategy to minimize inter-vehicle crash risks in automated driving environments. The proposed methodology consists of the following three components: a risk estimation module, a risk map construction module, and a vehicle speed control module. The essence of the proposed strategy is to adjust the subject vehicle speed based on an analysis of the interactions among a subject vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Crash risks are quantified by a fault tree analysis (FTA) method to integrate the crash occurrence potential and crash severity at every time step. A crash risk map is then constructed by projecting the integrated risk of the subject vehicle into a two-dimensional space composed of relative speed and relative spacing data. Next, the vehicle speed is continuously controlled to reach the target speed using risk map analysis to prevent a crash. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated by a VISSIM simulator with various traffic congestion levels and market penetration rates (MPR) of controlled vehicles. For example, an approximate 50\% reduction rate of the crash potential was achievable without a loss of the operational performance of the traffic stream when all vehicles were controlled by the proposed methodology under the level of service (LOS) C conditions. This study is meaningful in that vehicle speed control is performed for the purpose of speed harmonization in a traffic stream based on a comprehensive analysis of inter-vehicle risks. It is expected that the outcome of this study will be valuable for supporting the development of vehicle control systems for preventing crashes in automated driving environments.},

First, there is an opportunity to improve the risk estimation method.
Various contributing factors affecting inter-vehicle risks need to be
considered when estimating the risk, including adverse weather and
road geometric conditions in addition to the vehicle performance.
Second, more effective and intelligent techniques for obtaining the
target speed should be studied. For example, machine learning techniques
that have received much attention recently should be applied
and investigated to improve the performance. One feasible alternative
is the design of an artificial intelligence controller based on reinforcement
learning, which the authors have been working on as a further
study. Third, there should be an attempt to obtain the target speed to
address multiple other objectives, including the operational efficiency
and the environmental impacts, rather than just focusing on the safety.
This is because these three objectives are fundamentally determined by
individual vehicle maneuverings. Finally, more systematic simulation
calibration and validation need to be conducted with a larger vehicle
trajectory dataset. Various traffic conditions and vehicle types should
also be taken into consideration in comparing the actual data and the

Results showed that the eco-safe HMI system did not cause visual distraction. In contrast, the advice only or feedback only information improved forward gazing on the roadway. In addition, drivers tended to adapt their visual scanning strategies according to the traffic situations. In the car-following situation they paid longer glances to the forward roadway, while in the intersections they spent more time to look at the HMI system. The findings indicated that our eco-safe driving system improved drivers’ eco-safe behaviours and meanwhile enhanced their visual attention on road while no evidence showed that drivers were distracted by it.},

With recent advancements in data collection techniques, abundant real-time traffic data is available for use.

The dependent variable is monthly crash count on a roadway segment (with homogeneous horizontal and vertical profiles). A Bayesian spatio-temporal model is proposed to measure the association between crash frequency and possible risk factors including traffic composition, presence of curve and slope, weather conditions, and their interactions. The proposed model can also accommodate the unstructured random effect, and spatio-temporal correlation and interactions. Results of parameter estimation indicate that the interactions between wind speed and slope, between precipitation and curve, and between visibility and slope are significantly correlated to the increase in the freeway crash risk, while the interaction between precipitation and slope is significantly correlated to the reduction in the freeway crash risk, respectively. These findings are indicative of the design and implementation of real-time traffic management and control measures, e.g. variable message sign, that could mitigate the crash risk under the adverse weather conditions.},

While the federal regulatory agency has instituted a compliance review-based rating method to encourage carriers to improve their safety levels, concerns have been expressed regarding the effectiveness of the current ratings. In this paper, we consider a crash rate level (high, medium, and low) rather than a compliance review-based rating (satisfactory, conditional satisfactory, and unsatisfactory). We demonstrate an automated way of predicting the crash rate levels for each carrier using three different classification models (Artificial Neural Network, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Support Vector Machine) and three separate variable selection methods (Empirical Evidence, Multiple Factor Analysis, Garson's algorithm). The predicted crash rate levels (high, low) are compared to the assigned levels based on the current safety rating method. The results indicate the feasibility of crash rate level as an effective measure of carrier safety, with CART having the best performance.},

It also helps identify and prevent crashes before they happen. However, collecting real-time wide-coverage traffic information for crash prediction has been challenging. More importantly, previous studies have failed to consider the characteristics of the traffic platoon (vehicle group) that the crash vehicle belongs to before the crash occurs. This paper aims to model crash propensity based on traffic platoon characteristics collected by the floating car method, which provides a time-efficient and reliable solution to collecting traffic information. Crash and floating car data are collected from the Middle Ring Expressway in Shanghai, China. Both the binary logistic model and the support vector machine are applied. A data preparation method, involving crash data filtering, floating car data filtering and data matching on the road network, is introduced for the safety analysis purpose. Results suggest that the traffic platoon information collected from floating cars accompanied works reasonably in predicting crashes on expressways. The support vector machine, with an overall accuracy of 85\%, outperformed the binary logistic model which had an overall accuracy of 60\%. Results further suggest the application of floating car technologies and the support vector machine in real-time crash prediction. Despite this, the study also concludes the merits of the binary logistic model over the support vector machine model in explaining the impact of different factors that contribute to crash occurrences.},

abstract = {In the United States, there are approximately 212,000 highway-rail grade crossings, some of which experience vehicle-train incidents that often cause a massive financial burden, loss of life, and injury. In 2017, there were 2,108 highway-rail incidents resulting in 827 injuries and 307 fatalities nationwide. To eliminate collision risks, crossing grade separation and active alarm improvement are commonly used. Moreover, crossing closures are considered to be the most effective safety improvement program. While it may be very difficult, and in some cases impossible to close crossings, there are some incentive programs that facilitate the closure process. One of these programs is a working consolidation model that aims to determine crossing closure suitability. Using details of highway-rail grade crossings in the United States and applying an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) algorithm, this paper proposes a data-driven consolidation model that takes into consideration a number of engineering variables. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 0.991 for the proposed model. In addition, the developed XGboost consolidation model reported the relative importance of the variables input to the model, offering an in-depth understanding of the model’s behavior. Finally, for the practical implementation of the model, a simplified version containing fewer variables was developed. A sensitivity analysis was performed considering the aggregate gain and the different correlation threshold values between variables. This analysis developed a simplified model utilizing 14 variables, with aggregated gain values of 75\% and a correlation threshold of 0.9 which would perform similarly to the full model. Based on this model, 62\% of current highway-rail grade crossings should be closed.},

This review examined the prognostic role of fault on health, mental health, pain and work outcomes after transport injury. A systematic search of five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library) yielded 16,324 records published between 2000 and January 2018. Eligibility criteria were: adult transport injury survivors; prospective design; multivariable analysis; fault-related factor analysed; pain, mental health, general health or work-related outcome. Citations (n = 10,558, excluding duplicates) and full text articles (n = 555) were screened manually (Reviewer 1), and using concurrent machine learning and text mining (Reviewer 2; using Abstrackr, WordStat and QDA miner). Data from 55 papers that met all inclusion criteria were extracted, papers were evaluated for risk of bias using the QUIPS tool, and overall level of evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool. There were six main fault-related factors classified as: fault or responsibility, fault-based compensation, lawyer involvement or litigation, blame or guilt, road user or position in vehicle, and impact direction. Overall there were inconsistent associations between fault and transport injury outcomes, and 60\% of papers had high risk of bias. There was moderate evidence that fault-based compensation claims were associated with poorer health-related outcomes, and that lawyer involvement was associated with poorer work outcomes beyond 12 months post-injury. However, the evidence of negative associations between fault-based compensation claims and work-related outcomes was limited. Lawyer involvement and fault-based compensation claims were associated with adverse mental health outcomes six months post-injury, but not beyond 12 months. The most consistent associations between fault and negative outcomes were not for fault attributions, per se, but were related to fault-related procedures (e.g., lawyer engagement, fault-based compensation claims).},

This study develops the logistic regression (LR) model and five typical non-parametric models including, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF) to examine the relationship between influencing factors and vehicle collision risk. Based on the vehicle trajectory data extracted from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos using an automated video analysis system, the unconstrained vehicle motion’s collision risk can be evaluated by the extended time to collision (ETTC). Results of model performance comparison indicate that not all non-parametric models have a better prediction performance than the LR model. Specifically, the KNN, SVM, DT and RF models have better model performance than LR model in model training, while the ANN model has the worst model performance. In model prediction, the accuracy of LR model is higher than that of other five non-parametric models under various ETTC thresholds conditions. The LR model implies a pretty good performance and its results also indicate that vehicle yields the higher collision risk when it drives on the left side of toll plaza diverging area and more dangerous situations could be found for an ETC vehicle. Moreover, the vehicle collision risks are positively associated with the speed of the following vehicle and the angle between the leading vehicle speed vector and X axis. Furthermore, the results of DT model show that three factors play important roles in classifying vehicle collision risk and the effects of them on collision risk are consistent with the results of LR model. These findings provide valuable information for accurate assessment of collision risk, which is a key step toward improving safety performance of the toll plaza diverging area.},

The prediction performance of driving features, EEG features and hybrid features of them was evaluated and compared. The results indicated that EEG-based model has better performance than driving-data-based model (i.e., 83.84\% versus 71.59\%) and the integrated model of driving features and the full brain regions features extracted by wavelet analysis outperforms other types of features with the highest accuracy of 86.27\%.},

Crash data sets are highly skewed where fatalities and severe injuries are often less represented compared to other events. The severity prediction performance of the existing models is poor due to the highly imbalanced samples of different severity levels within a given dataset. This paper proposes a machine learning based analysis framework from a multi-class classification perspective for accurate recognition of the driver injury patterns. The proposed framework includes preprocessing, classification, evaluation and application of a given dataset. This framework is verified based on the three years single-vehicle ROR (run-off-road) crash records collected in Washington State from 2011 to 2013. At first, thirteen most important safety-related variables are recognized through random forests. Then, the four driver’s injury severity levels viz., fatal/serious injury, evident injury, possible injury, and no injury are predicted by integrating the decomposed binary neural network models to achieve better performance. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to interpret variables’ impacts on the decomposed injury severity levels. The study shows that lack of restraint, female drivers, truck usage, driver impairment, driver distraction, vehicle overturn (rollover), dawn/dusk, and overtaking are the leading factors contributing to the driver fatalities or severe injuries in a single-vehicle ROR crash. Most of the findings are consistent with the previous studies. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework which can be further applied for pattern recognition in traffic safety research.},

abstract = {Accident events are generally unexpected and occur rarely. Pre-accident risk assessment by surrogate indicators is an effective way to identify risk levels and thus boost accident prediction. Herein, the concept of Key Risk Indicator (KRI) is proposed, which assesses risk exposures using hybrid indicators. Seven metrics are shortlisted as the basic indicators in KRI, with evaluation in terms of risk behaviour, risk avoidance, and risk margin. A typical real-world chain-collision accident and its antecedent (pre-crash) road traffic movements are retrieved from surveillance video footage, and a grid remapping method is proposed for data extraction and coordinates transformation. To investigate the feasibility of each indicator in risk assessment, a temporal-spatial case-control is designed. By comparison, Time Integrated Time-to-collision (TIT) performs better in identifying pre-accident risk conditions; while Crash Potential Index (CPI) is helpful in further picking out the severest ones (the near-accident). Based on TIT and CPI, the expressions of KRIs are developed, which enable us to evaluate risk severity with three levels, as well as the likelihood. KRI-based risk assessment also reveals predictive insights about a potential accident, including at-risk vehicles, locations and time. Furthermore, straightforward thresholds are defined flexibly in KRIs, since the impact of different threshold values is found not to be very critical. For better validation, another independent real-world accident sample is examined, and the two results are in close agreement. Hierarchical indicators such as KRIs offer new insights about pre-accident risk exposures, which is helpful for accident assessment and prediction.},

abstract = {The sequence of instantaneous driving decisions and its variations, known as driving volatility, prior to involvement in safety critical events can be a leading indicator of safety. This study focuses on the component of “driving volatility matrix” related to specific normal and safety-critical events, named “event-based volatility.” The research issue is characterizing volatility in instantaneous driving decisions in the longitudinal and lateral directions, and how it varies across drivers involved in normal driving, crash, and/or near-crash events. To explore the issue, a rigorous quasi-experimental study design is adopted to help compare driving behaviors in normal vs unsafe outcomes. Using a unique real-world naturalistic driving database from the 2nd Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP), a test set of 9593 driving events featuring 2.2 million temporal samples of real-world driving are analyzed. This study features a plethora of kinematic sensors, video, and radar spatiotemporal data about vehicle movement and therefore offers the opportunity to initiate such exploration. By using information related to longitudinal and lateral accelerations and vehicular jerk, 24 different aggregate and segmented measures of driving volatility are proposed that captures variations in extreme instantaneous driving decisions. In doing so, careful attention is given to the issue of intentional vs. unintentional volatility. The volatility indices, as leading indicators of near-crash and crash events, are then linked with safety critical events, crash propensity, and other event specific explanatory variables. Owing to the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and omitted variable bias, fixed- and random-parameter discrete choice models are developed that relate crash propensity to unintentional driving volatility and other factors. Statistically significant evidence is found that driver volatilities in near-crash and crash events are significantly greater than volatility in normal driving events. After controlling for traffic, roadway, and unobserved factors, the results suggest that greater intentional volatility increases the likelihood of both crash and near-crash events. A one-unit increase in intentional volatility is associated with positive vehicular jerk in longitudinal direction increases the chance of crash and near-crash outcome by 15.79 and 12.52 percentage points, respectively. Importantly, intentional volatility in positive vehicular jerk in lateral direction has more negative consequences than intentional volatility in positive vehicular jerk in longitudinal direction. Compared to acceleration/deceleration, vehicular jerk can better characterize the volatility in microscopic instantaneous driving decisions prior to involvement in safety critical events. Finally, the magnitudes of correlations exhibit significant heterogeneity, and that accounting for the heterogeneous effects in the modeling framework can provide more reliable and accurate results. The study demonstrates the value of quasi-experimental study design and big data analytics for understanding extreme driving behaviors in safe vs. unsafe driving outcomes.},

abstract = {The use of mobile phones while driving remains a major human factors issue in the transport system. A significant safety concern is that driving while distracted by a mobile phone potentially modifies the driving speed leading to conflicts with other road users and consequently increases crash risk. However, the lack of systematic knowledge of the mechanisms involved in speed adaptation of distracted drivers constrains the explanation and modelling of the extent of this phenomenon. The objective of this study was to investigate speed adaptation of distracted drivers under varying road infrastructure and traffic complexity conditions. The CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator was used to test participants on a simulated road with different traffic conditions, such as free flow traffic along straight roads, driving in urbanized areas, and driving in heavy traffic along suburban roads. Thirty-two licensed young drivers drove the simulator under three phone conditions: baseline (no phone conversation), hands-free and handheld phone conversations. To understand the relationships between distraction, road infrastructure and traffic complexity, speed adaptation calculated as the deviation of driving speed from the posted speed limit was modelled using a decision tree. The identified groups of road infrastructure and traffic characteristics from the decision tree were then modelled with a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with repeated measures to develop inferences about speed adaptation behaviour of distracted drivers. The GLMM also included driver characteristics and secondary task demands as predictors of speed adaptation. Results indicated that complex road environments like urbanization, car-following situations along suburban roads, and curved road alignment significantly influenced speed adaptation behaviour. Distracted drivers selected a lower speed while driving along a curved road or during car-following situations, but speed adaptation was negligible in the presence of high visual cutter, indicating the prioritization of the driving task over the secondary task. Additionally, drivers who scored high on self-reported safe attitudes towards mobile phone usage, and who reported prior involvement in a road traffic crash, selected a lower driving speed in the distracted condition than in the baseline. The results aid in understanding how driving task demands influence speed adaptation of distracted drivers under various road infrastructure and traffic complexity conditions.},

abstract = {Measuring risk is critical for collision avoidance. The paper aims to develop an online risk level classification algorithm for forward collision avoidance systems. Assuming risk levels are reflected by braking profiles, deceleration curves from critical evasive braking events from the Virginia “100-car” database were first extracted. The curves are then clustered into different risk levels based on spectrum clustering, using curve distance and curve changing rate as dissimilarity metrics among deceleration curves. Fuzzy logic rules of safety indicators at critical braking onset for risk classification were then extracted according to the clustered risk levels. The safety indicators include time to collision, time headway, and final relative distance under emergency braking, which characterizes three kinds of uncertain critical conditions respectively. Finally, the obtained fuzzy risk level classification algorithm was tested and compared with other Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) algorithms under Euro-NCAP testing scenarios in simulation. Results show the proposed algorithm is promising in balancing the objectives of avoiding collision and reducing interference with driver’s normal driving compared with other algorithms.},

addendum = {The proposed framework
provides a new perspective on real-time risk level classification and
collision avoidance system development. However, since there is a
limitation in data sample size representing critical event-reaction
braking, more deceleration profiles (by collecting more near-crash 
records from other resources) should be explored to improve parameter
tuning of the proposed fuzzy logic in the future (especially obtaining
more higher-speed observations to overcome the current limitation in
the algorithm for higher-speed braking scenarios). Besides, traffic/
driver/vehicle characteristics (such as vehicle type, driver state, and
vehicle response during braking, etc.) need to be investigated in future
research concerning their possible effects on timing of critical braking.
Also, variations of safety indicators representing uncertain critical
driving scenarios could be further considered, and the probability of the
uncertain scenarios could also be explored (by predicting accelerating/
decelerating behaviors of SV and POV in V2V environments) and introduced
into the fuzzy logic (by assigning probability-based weights of
fuzzy rules) to improve its risk level classification performance. In addition,
other machine learning classification algorithms (such as
Support Vector Machine) instead of fuzzy logic could be explored to
learn the effective representation of risk levels derived from offline
deceleration profiles in further study.}

Efforts have been investigated to reveal the crash mechanisms and analyze the contributing factors from the aspects of vehicle, driver, and operational perspectives. In this study, special attention has been paid to the operational level analyses while bridging the research gaps of: (1) failing to identify the heterogeneous impact of microscopic traffic flow variables on crash occurrence, and (2) focusing on correlation effects without further investigations for the causal relationships. A hybrid modeling approach with latent class logit (LCL) and path analysis (PA) models was proposed to account for the heterogeneous influencing effects and reveal the causal relationships between crash occurrence and microscopic traffic flow variables. Data from Shanghai urban expressway system were utilized for the empirical analyses. First, the LCL model has concluded four latent subsets of crash occurrence influencing factors. Then, PA models were conducted to identify the concurrent relationships (direct and indirect eﬀ ;ects) for the four sets of crash occurrence influencing factors separately. Finally, the results of the LCL model and PA models were compared and the crash-prone scenarios were inferred. And the potential safety improvement countermeasures were discussed.},

(1) First, this study employed matched case-control data structure with
a fixed crash and non-crash ratio (1:4) to deal with the imbalanced
crash risk analysis dataset. In future studies, other sampling techniques,
such as over-sampling methods of synthetic minority oversampling
technique (SMOTE) (Chawla et al., 2002) and full-size

concurrent microscopic influencing factors need to be revealed.
(2) Second, this study utilized the LCL model to group observations to
account for the heterogeneity issues, and future efforts would be
conducted to identify how to improve the proposed hybrid approach
from the aspects of incorporating other clustering methods,
such finite mixture model (FMM) (Park and Lord, 2009).
(3) Moreover, after applying the LCL model to solve the heterogeneity
issues, repeated measures still exist within a latent class. In this
study, the matched case-control data preparation process can
greatly reduce the impacts of repeated measures on the analysis
results. While in future studies, other methods would be tested to
solve this repeated measurement issues, such as incorporating the
LCL model with roadway section unique random effect terms.
(4) In addition, in this study, the PA models were employed to conduct
the causal inference, which is a typical mediation analysis method.
Additional efforts are needed to utilize other causal inference
methods (Pearl, 2018), like propensity score matching (PSM) (Li

causal relationships between crash occurrence and the microscopic

The data used from the Chicago metropolitan expressways was collected between December 2016 and December 2017, and it includes 244 traffic accidents and 6073 non-accident cases. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) is employed to interpret the results and analyze the importance of individual features. The results show that XGBoost can detect accidents robustly with an accuracy, detection rate, and a false alarm rate of 99 \%, 79 \%, and 0.16 \%, respectively. Several traffic related features, especially difference of speed between 5 min before and 5 min after an accident, are found to have relatively more impact on the occurrence of accidents. Furthermore, a feature dependency analysis is conducted for three pairs of features. First, average daily traffic and speed after accidents/non-accidents time at the upstream location are interpreted jointly. Then, distance to Central Business District and residential density are analyzed. Finally, speed after accidents/non-accidents time at upstream location and speed after accidents/non-accidents time at downstream location are evaluated with respect to the model’s output.},

abstract = {This paper analyses driving behaviour in car-following conditions, based on extensive individual vehicle data collected during experimental field surveys carried out in Italy and the UK. The aim is to contribute to identify simple evidence to be exploited in the ongoing process of driving assistance and automation which, in turn, would reduce rear-end crashes. In particular, identification of differences and similarities in observed car-following behaviours for different samples of drivers could justify common tuning, at a European or worldwide level, of a technological solution aimed at active safety, or, in the event of differences, could suggest the most critical aspects to be taken into account for localisation or customisation of driving assistance solutions. Without intending to be exhaustive, this paper moves one step in this direction. Indeed, driving behaviour and human errors are considered to be among the main crash contributory factors, and a promising approach for safety improvement is the progressive introduction of increasing levels of driving automation in next-generation vehicles, according to the active/preventive safety approach. However, the more advanced the system, the more complex will be the integration in the vehicle, and the interaction with the driver may sometimes become unproductive, or risky, should the driver be removed from the driving control loop. Thus, implementation of these systems will require the interaction of human driving logics with automation logics and then an enhanced ability in modelling drivers’ behaviour. This will allow both higher active-safety levels and higher user acceptance to be achieved, thus ensuring that the driver is always in the control loop, even if his/her role is limited to supervising the automatic logic. Currently, the driving mode most targeted by driving assistance systems is longitudinal driving. This is required in various driving conditions, among which car-following assumes key importance because of the huge number of rear-end crashes. The increased availability of lower-cost information and communication technologies (ICTs) has enhanced the possibility of collecting copious and reliable car-following individual vehicle data. In this work, data collected from three different experiments, two carried out in Italy and one in the UK, are analysed and compared. The experiments involved 146 drivers (105 Italian drivers and 41 UK drivers). Data were collected by two instrumented vehicles. Our analysis focused on inter-vehicular spacing in equilibrium car-following conditions. We observed that (i) the adopted equilibrium spacing can be fitted using lognormal distributions, (ii) the adopted equilibrium spacing increases with speed, and (iii) the dispersion between drivers increases with speed. In addition, according to different headway thresholds (up to 1 second) a significant number of potentially dangerous behaviours is observed. Three different car-following paradigms are also applied to each of the experiments, and modelling parameters are calibrated and compared to obtain indirect confirmation about the observed similarities and differences in driving behaviour.},

abstract = {The concept of human reliability has been widely used in industrial settings by human factors experts to optimise the person-task fit. Reliability is estimated by the probability that a task will successfully be completed by personnel in a given stage of system operation. Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) is a technique used to calculate human error probabilities as the ratio of errors committed to the number of opportunities for that error. To transfer this notion to the measurement of car driver reliability the following components are necessary: a taxonomy of driving tasks, a definition of correct behaviour in each of these tasks, a list of errors as deviations from the correct actions and an adequate observation method to register errors and opportunities for these errors. Use of the SAFE-task analysis procedure recently made it possible to derive driver errors directly from the normative analysis of behavioural requirements. Driver reliability estimates could be used to compare groups of tasks (e.g. different types of intersections with their respective regulations) as well as groups of drivers’ or individual drivers’ aptitudes. This approach was tested in a field study with 62 drivers of different age groups. The subjects drove an instrumented car and had to complete an urban test route, the main features of which were 18 intersections representing six different driving tasks. The subjects were accompanied by two trained observers who recorded driver errors using standardized observation sheets. Results indicate that error indices often vary between both the age group of drivers and the type of driving task. The highest error indices occurred in the non-signalised intersection tasks and the roundabout, which exactly equals the corresponding ratings of task complexity from the SAFE analysis. A comparison of age groups clearly shows the disadvantage of older drivers, whose error indices in nearly all tasks are significantly higher than those of the other groups. The vast majority of these errors could be explained by high task load in the intersections, as they represent difficult tasks. The discussion shows how reliability estimates can be used in a constructive way to propose changes in car design, intersection layout and regulation as well as driver training.},

abstract = {Work zones especially long-term work zones increase traffic conflicts and cause safety problems. Proper casualty risk assessment for a work zone is of importance for both traffic safety engineers and travelers. This paper develops a novel probabilistic quantitative risk assessment (QRA) model to evaluate the casualty risk combining frequency and consequence of all accident scenarios triggered by long-term work zone crashes. The casualty risk is measured by the individual risk and societal risk. The individual risk can be interpreted as the frequency of a driver/passenger being killed or injured, and the societal risk describes the relation between frequency and the number of casualties. The proposed probabilistic QRA model consists of the estimation of work zone crash frequency, an event tree and consequence estimation models. There are seven intermediate events – age (A), crash unit (CU), vehicle type (VT), alcohol (AL), light condition (LC), crash type (CT) and severity (S) – in the event tree. Since the estimated value of probability for some intermediate event may have large uncertainty, the uncertainty can thus be characterized by a random variable. The consequence estimation model takes into account the combination effects of speed and emergency medical service response time (ERT) on the consequence of work zone crash. Finally, a numerical example based on the Southeast Michigan work zone crash data is carried out. The numerical results show that there will be a 62\% decrease of individual fatality risk and 44\% reduction of individual injury risk if the mean travel speed is slowed down by 20\%. In addition, there will be a 5\% reduction of individual fatality risk and 0.05\% reduction of individual injury risk if ERT is reduced by 20\%. In other words, slowing down speed is more effective than reducing ERT in the casualty risk mitigation.},

There is evidence that drivers with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are at an increased risk for unsafe driving. Recent advances in sensor, computer, and telecommunication technologies provide a method for automatically collecting detailed, objective information about the driving performance of drivers, including those with early stage dementia. The objective of this project was to use in-vehicle technology to describe a set of driving behaviors that may be common in individuals with early stage dementia (i.e., a diagnosis of memory loss) and compare these behaviors to a group of drivers without cognitive impairment. Seventeen drivers with a diagnosis of early stage dementia, who had completed a comprehensive driving assessment and were cleared to drive, participated in the study. Participants had their vehicles instrumented with a suite of sensors and a data acquisition system, and drove 1–2 months as they would under normal circumstances. Data from the in-vehicle instrumentation were reduced and analyzed, using a set of algorithms/heuristics developed by the research team. Data from the early stage dementia group were compared to similar data from an existing dataset of 26 older drivers without dementia. The early stage dementia group was found to have significantly restricted driving space relative to the comparison group. At the same time, the early stage dementia group (which had been previously cleared by an occupational therapist as safe to drive) drove as safely as the comparison group. Few safety-related behavioral errors were found for either group. Wayfinding problems were rare among both groups, but the early stage dementia group was significantly more likely to get lost.},

This paper discusses the utilization of Bayesian networks in maritime safety modeling. Based on literature and the author's own experiences, the paper studies what Bayesian networks can offer to maritime accident prevention and safety modeling and discusses a few challenges in their application to this context. It is argued that the capability of representing rather complex, not necessarily causal but uncertain relationships makes Bayesian networks an attractive modeling tool for the maritime safety and accidents. Furthermore, as the maritime accident and safety data is still rather scarce and has some quality problems, the possibility to combine data with expert knowledge and the easy way of updating the model after acquiring more evidence further enhance their feasibility. However, eliciting the probabilities from the maritime experts might be challenging and the model validation can be tricky. It is concluded that with the utilization of several data sources, Bayesian updating, dynamic modeling, and hidden nodes for latent variables, Bayesian networks are rather well-suited tools for the maritime safety management and decision-making.},

abstract = {Objective
To synthesise recent research on the use of machine learning approaches to mining textual injury surveillance data.
Design
Systematic review.
Data sources
The electronic databases which were searched included PubMed, Cinahl, Medline, Google Scholar, and Proquest. The bibliography of all relevant articles was examined and associated articles were identified using a snowballing technique.
Selection criteria
For inclusion, articles were required to meet the following criteria: (a) used a health-related database, (b) focused on injury-related cases, AND used machine learning approaches to analyse textual data.
Methods
The papers identified through the search were screened resulting in 16 papers selected for review. Articles were reviewed to describe the databases and methodology used, the strength and limitations of different techniques, and quality assurance approaches used. Due to heterogeneity between studies meta-analysis was not performed.
Results
Occupational injuries were the focus of half of the machine learning studies and the most common methods described were Bayesian probability or Bayesian network based methods to either predict injury categories or extract common injury scenarios. Models were evaluated through either comparison with gold standard data or content expert evaluation or statistical measures of quality. Machine learning was found to provide high precision and accuracy when predicting a small number of categories, was valuable for visualisation of injury patterns and prediction of future outcomes. However, difficulties related to generalizability, source data quality, complexity of models and integration of content and technical knowledge were discussed.
Conclusions
The use of narrative text for injury surveillance has grown in popularity, complexity and quality over recent years. With advances in data mining techniques, increased capacity for analysis of large databases, and involvement of computer scientists in the injury prevention field, along with more comprehensive use and description of quality assurance methods in text mining approaches, it is likely that we will see a continued growth and advancement in knowledge of text mining in the injury field.},

abstract = {In-depth studies of behavioral factors in road accidents using conventional methods are often inconclusive and costly. In a series of studies exploring alternative approaches, 200 cross-flow junction road accidents were sampled from the files of Nottinghamshire Constabulary, England, coded for computer analysis using a specially devised ‘Traffic Related Action Analysis Language’, and then examined using different computational and statistical techniques. For comparison, the same analyses were also carried out on 100 descriptions of safe turns, and 100 descriptions of hypothetical accidents provided by experienced drivers. The present study used statistical methods to explore the database of cases. The youngest and oldest groups of drivers were found to be over-represented in the junction accidents, and were the least likely to stop before turning. The young drivers had particular problems turning onto major roads. Women were more likely than men to stop before turning; they tended to have their collisions with other women; and they were under-represented as drivers of the non-turning vehicle. In hypothetical accidents, informants tended to blame the younger driver, increasingly so for male informants as they got older. Female informants tended to blame male drivers.},

abstract = {The objective of an accident-mapping algorithm is to snap traffic accidents onto the correct road segments. Assigning accidents onto the correct segments facilitate to robustly carry out some key analyses in accident research including the identification of accident hot-spots, network-level risk mapping and segment-level accident risk modelling. Existing risk mapping algorithms have some severe limitations: (i) they are not easily ‘transferable’ as the algorithms are specific to given accident datasets; (ii) they do not perform well in all road-network environments such as in areas of dense road network; and (iii) the methods used do not perform well in addressing inaccuracies inherent in and type of road environment. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new accident mapping algorithm based on the common variables observed in most accident databases (e.g. road name and type, direction of vehicle movement before the accident and recorded accident location). The challenges here are to: (i) develop a method that takes into account uncertainties inherent to the recorded traffic accident data and the underlying digital road network data, (ii) accurately determine the type and proportion of inaccuracies, and (iii) develop a robust algorithm that can be adapted for any accident set and road network of varying complexity. In order to overcome these challenges, a distance based pattern-matching approach is used to identify the correct road segment. This is based on vectors containing feature values that are common in the accident data and the network data. Since each feature does not contribute equally towards the identification of the correct road segments, an ANN approach using the single-layer perceptron is used to assist in “learning” the relative importance of each feature in the distance calculation and hence the correct link identification. The performance of the developed algorithm was evaluated based on a reference accident dataset from the UK confirming that the accuracy is much better than other methods.},

Several systematic safety risk assessment approaches, such as fault tree analysis (FTA) and failure mode and effect criticality analysis (FMECA), have been used to evaluate safety risks at SC projects. However, these traditional methods ineffectively address dependencies among safety factors at various levels that fail to provide early warnings to prevent occupational accidents. To overcome the limitations of traditional approaches, this study addresses the development of a safety risk-assessment model for SC projects by establishing the Bayesian networks (BN) based on fault tree (FT) transformation. The BN-based safety risk-assessment model was validated against the safety inspection records of six SC building projects and nine projects in which site accidents occurred. The ranks of posterior probabilities from the BN model were highly consistent with the accidents that occurred at each project site. The model accurately provides site safety-management abilities by calculating the probabilities of safety risks and further analyzing the causes of accidents based on their relationships in BNs. In practice, based on the analysis of accident risks and significant safety factors, proper preventive safety management strategies can be established to reduce the occurrence of accidents on SC sites.},

Road accident data for a period of 2–6 years on different sections of 8 National and State Highways in Haryana was collected from police records. Data related to road geometry, traffic and road environment related variables was collected through field studies. Total two hundred and twenty two data points were gathered by dividing highways into sections with certain uniform geometric characteristics. For prediction of accident frequencies using fifteen input parameters, two modeling approaches: FENB/RENB regression and M5 model tree were used. Results suggest that both models perform comparably well in terms of correlation coefficient and root mean square error values. M5 model tree provides simple linear equations that are easy to interpret and provide better insight, indicating that this approach can effectively be used as an alternative to RENB approach if the sole purpose is to predict motor vehicle crashes. Sensitivity analysis using M5 model tree also suggests that its results reflect the physical conditions. Both models clearly indicate that to improve safety on Indian highways minor accesses to the highways need to be properly designed and controlled, the service roads to be made functional and dispersion of speeds is to be brought down.},

An application is considered with regards to the scenarios generated following a steam generator tube rupture in a nuclear power plant. The scenarios are generated by the accident dynamic simulator (ADS), coupled to a RELAP code that simulates the thermo-hydraulic behavior of the plant and to an operators’ crew model, which simulates their cognitive and procedures-guided responses. A set of 60 scenarios has been generated by the ADS DET tool. The classification approach has grouped the 60 scenarios into 4 classes of dominant scenarios, one of which was not anticipated a priori but was “discovered” by the classifier. The proposed approach may be considered as a first effort towards the application of identification and classification approaches to scenarios post-processing for real-scale dynamic safety assessments.},

abstract = {Horse riders represent a significant group of vulnerable road user and are involved in a number of accidents and near misses on the road. Despite this horse riders have received little attention both in terms of academic research and transport policy. Based on literature on vulnerable road user safety, including attitudes to road user safety and behaviour of drivers and their relationship with cyclists and motorcyclists, this paper examines the attitudes and reported behaviour of drivers and horse riders. A total of 46 participants took part in six focus groups divided into four groups of drivers with little or no horse riding experience and two groups of frequent horse riders. Each group investigated five key topic areas stemming from the literature review on vulnerable road users including hazard perception, risk perception, emotion, attitudes to sharing the road and empathy. It was found that drivers and horse riders are not always aware of the same hazards in the road and that this may lead drivers to under-estimate the risk when encountering horses. Drivers often had good intentions to overtake horses safely, but were unaware of how vulnerable passing very wide and slow made them feel until they had begun the manoeuvre and hence quickly reduced such feelings either by speeding up or cutting in too soon. However, other than this, drivers had good skills when encountering horses. But these skills could be impeded by frustration when encountering a slow moving horse which was further compounded by a feeling, mainly by younger drivers, that horse riding was for leisure and as such should not get in the way of necessary work journeys. There is a need for drivers to be more aware of the potential hazards a horse rider faces on the road and these could be achieved through inducing empathy amongst drivers for horse riders, creating nudges for drivers in the environment and better education for drivers.},

The factors explored include geometric predictors (e.g., presence and type of crosswalk and presence of pedestrian refuge area), traffic predictors (e.g., annual average daily traffic (AADT), speed limit, and percentage of trucks), road user variables (e.g., pedestrian age and pedestrian maneuver before crash), environmental predictors (e.g., weather and lighting conditions), and vehicle-related predictors (e.g., vehicle type). The analysis was conducted using the mixed logit model, which allows the parameter estimates to randomly vary across the observations. The study used three years of pedestrian crash data from Florida. Police reports were reviewed in detail to have a better understanding of how each pedestrian crash occurred. Additionally, information that is unavailable in the crash records, such as at-fault road user and pedestrian maneuver, was collected. At signalized intersections, higher AADT, speed limit, and percentage of trucks; very old pedestrians; at-fault pedestrians; rainy weather; and dark lighting condition were associated with higher pedestrian severity risk. For example, a one-percent higher truck percentage increases the probability of severe injuries by 1.37\%. A one-mile-per-hour higher speed limit increases the probability of severe injuries by 1.22\%. At unsignalized intersections, pedestrian walking along roadway, middle and very old pedestrians, at-fault pedestrians, vans, dark lighting condition, and higher speed limit were associated with higher pedestrian severity risk. On the other hand, standard crosswalks were associated with 1.36\% reduction in pedestrian severe injuries. Several countermeasures to reduce pedestrian injury severity are recommended.},

The results indicated that the feeling of control was not only positively linked to the feeling of invulnerability, but that these two factors were negatively linked to risk perception. In addition, the actors in both production sectors were more motivated to participate in EBA of accidents linked to the core processes of their industry (which were more accurately perceived) than in EBA of ordinary accidents (accidents not specific to chemical or nuclear processes). Moreover, the agents’ feeling of invulnerability and feeling of control both reduced EBA motivation for ordinary accidents to a greater extent than for chemical and radiation-related accidents.

Accident risk ratios (ARRs), however, proved to be higher for younger workers than older ones, in both the non-specific and the specific cases. However, two accident patterns (specific risks) also show relatively high ARRs among workers in their 40s (and even 30s), results that might be explained by particular exposures and/or age-related performance problems.

MARS has a promising prediction power, and does not suffer from interpretation complexity. Negative Binomial (NB) and MARS models were fitted and compared using extensive data collected on unsignalized intersections in Florida. Two models were estimated for angle crash frequency at 3- and 4-legged unsignalized intersections. Treating crash frequency as a continuous response variable for fitting a MARS model was also examined by considering the natural logarithm of the crash frequency. Finally, combining MARS with another machine learning technique (random forest) was explored and discussed. The fitted NB angle crash models showed several significant factors that contribute to angle crash occurrence at unsignalized intersections such as, traffic volume on the major road, the upstream distance to the nearest signalized intersection, the distance between successive unsignalized intersections, median type on the major approach, percentage of trucks on the major approach, size of the intersection and the geographic location within the state. Based on the mean square prediction error (MSPE) assessment criterion, MARS outperformed the corresponding NB models. Also, using MARS for predicting continuous response variables yielded more favorable results than predicting discrete response variables. The generated MARS models showed the most promising results after screening the covariates using random forest. Based on the results of this study, MARS is recommended as an efficient technique for predicting crashes at unsignalized intersections (angle crashes in this study).},

abstract = {Objective
This paper evaluates two different types of in-vehicle interfaces to support anticipation in driving: one aids attention allocation and the other aids interpretation of traffic in addition to attention allocation.
Background
Anticipation is a competency that has been shown to facilitate safety and eco-driving through the efficient positioning of a vehicle for probable, upcoming changes in traffic. This competency has been shown to improve with driving experience. In an earlier simulator study, we showed that compared to novice drivers, experienced drivers exhibited a greater number of timely actions to avoid upcoming traffic conflicts. In this study, we seek to facilitate anticipation in general and for novice drivers in particular, who appear to lack the competency. We hypothesize that anticipation depends on two major steps and that it can be supported by aiding each: (1) conscious perception of relevant cues, and (2) effective processing of these cues to create a situational assessment as a basis for anticipation of future developments.
Method
We conducted a simulator experiment with 24 experienced and 24 novice drivers to evaluate two interfaces that were designed to aid the two hypothesized steps of anticipation. The attentional interface was designed to direct attention toward the most relevant cue. The interpretational interface represented several cues, and in addition to directing attention also aimed to aid sense-making of these cues.
Results
The results confirmed our hypothesis that novice drivers’ anticipation performance, as measured through timely actions to avoid upcoming traffic conflicts, would be improved with either interface type. However, results contradicted our expectation that novice drivers would obtain larger improvements with the interpretational interface. Experienced drivers performed better than novice drivers to begin with and did not show any statistically significant improvements with either interface.
Conclusion
Both interfaces improved anticipation performance for novice drivers. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of these interfaces in a wider variety of driving conditions, such as when the driver is multitasking.},

abstract = {The concept of safety culture has become established in safety management applications in all major safety-critical domains. The idea that safety culture somehow represents a “systemic view” on safety is seldom explicitly spoken out, but nevertheless seem to linger behind many safety culture discourses. However, in this paper we argue that the “new” contribution to safety management from safety culture never really became integrated with classical engineering principles and concepts. This integration would have been necessary for the development of a more genuine systems-oriented view on safety; e.g. a conception of safety in which human, technological, organisational and cultural factors are understood as mutually interacting elements. Without of this integration, researchers and the users of the various tools and methods associated with safety culture have sometimes fostered a belief that “safety culture” in fact represents such a systemic view about safety. This belief is, however, not backed up by theoretical or empirical evidence. It is true that safety culture, at least in some sense, represents a holistic term—a totality of factors that include human, organisational and technological aspects. However, the departure for such safety culture models is still human and organisational factors rather than technology (or safety) itself. The aim of this paper is to critically review the various uses of the concept of safety culture as representing a systemic view on safety. The article will take a look at the concepts of culture and safety culture based on previous studies, and outlines in more detail the theoretical challenges in safety culture as a systems concept. The paper also presents recommendations on how to make safety culture more systemic.},

abstract = {To date little research has examined safety climate in relation to macroergonomics and how the two distinct sub-disciplines can be integrated to affect safety outcomes. The purpose of macroergonomics is to design a fully “harmonized” work system that improves numerous aspects of organizational performance and effectiveness, and this is accomplished by incorporating the foundational theoretical framework of sociotechnical systems theory (STS). Two broad subsystems within such a system are the personnel subsystem, the ways individuals perform tasks, and the technological subsystem, the tasks to be performed. Management is an important aspect of the personnel subsystem, and there is a growing body of research regarding supervisors’ influence over employee safety. One such area of research is safety climate, which is based on the perception of workers regarding safety and organizational practices. Two major factors of safety climate are management commitment to safety and communication pertaining to safety as a true priority from both top management and direct supervisors. This article describes the conceptual overlaps of macroergonomics and safety climate in order to present a conceptual model that integrates these domains using the framework of mesoergonomics. In conclusion, we discuss how this model can serve as a framework to guide the analysis and design of work systems and subsequent organizational interventions.},

abstract = {To protect pedestrians, many countries give them priority at uncontrolled mid-block crosswalks or pedestrian crossings. However, the actual driver yielding rate is not always satisfactory (only 3.5\% in this study). To increase the yielding rate, this study proposed eleven pedestrian gestures to inform drivers of their intent to cross. The gestures were evaluated based on the process of human interaction with environment. Four gestures were selected as candidates to test in field experiments based on scores for visibility, clarity, familiarity and courtesy (see illustration in Fig. 2): (1) right elbow bent with hands erect and palm facing left (R-bent-erect), (2) left elbow bent with hands level and palm facing left (L-bent-level), (3) left arm extended straight to left side with palm erect facing left (L-straight-erect), and (4) a ‘T’ gesture for “Time-out”. In the experiment, confederate pedestrians waiting at the roadside displayed the gestures (baseline: no gesture) to 420 vehicles at 5 sites in Beijing, China. When pedestrians used the L-bent-level gesture, the vehicle yielding rate more than tripled of that in the baseline condition. The L-bent-level gesture also resulted in a significant decrease in driving with unchanged speed (63.5–38.8\%) and had no significant side effects in terms of drivers’ horn use or lane changing. The effects of such gestures in other contexts such as when pedestrians are in the crosswalk and when they are interacting with turning vehicles are discussed, together with the applications in training vulnerable pedestrian groups (children or elderly) and facilitating pedestrian detection by drivers.},

abstract = {Objectives
An experiment was conducted to assess the effects of retrospective and combined retrospective and concurrent feedback on driver performance and engagement in distracting activities.
Background
A previous study conducted by the authors showed that concurrent (or real time) feedback can help drivers better modulate their distracting activities. However, research also shows that concurrent feedback can pose additional distractions due to the limited time and resources available during driving. Retrospective feedback, which is presented at the end of a trip (i.e., post-drive), can include additional information on safety critical situations during a trip and help the driver learn safe driving habits.
Method
A driving simulator study was conducted with 48 participants and 3 conditions: retrospective feedback, combined feedback (both retrospective and concurrent), and no feedback (baseline case).
Results
The feedback conditions (retrospective and combined) resulted in faster response to lead vehicle braking events as depicted by shorter accelerator release times. Moreover, combined feedback also resulted in longer glances to the road.
Conclusions
The results suggest that both feedback types have potential to improve immediate driving performance and driver engagement in distractions.
Application
Combined feedback holds the most promise for mitigating the effects of distraction from in-vehicle information systems.},

Relevant data extracted from 143 accounts was initially coded as logical combinations of generic accident factors. A Bayesian Network (BN)-based model was then built for OAMDs using these data and expert knowledge. A data clustering process was subsequently performed to group the OAMDs into similar classes from generic factor occurrence and pattern standpoints. Finally, the Most Probable Explanation (MPE) was evaluated and identified as the associated recurrent scenario for each class. Using this approach, 8 scenarios were extracted to describe 143 OAMDs in the construction and metallurgy sectors. Their recurrent nature is discussed. Probable generic factor combinations provide a fair representation of particularly serious OAMDs, as described in narrative texts. This work represents a real contribution to raising company awareness of the variety of circumstances, in which these accidents occur, to progressing in the prevention of such accidents and to developing an analysis framework dedicated to this kind of accident.},

A modified version of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System was used to analyze incident and accident cases from across the state of Queensland to identify human factor trends and system deficiencies within mining. An analysis of the data revealed that skill-based errors were the most common unsafe act and showed no significant differences across mine types. However, decision errors did vary across mine types. Findings for unsafe acts were consistent across the time period examined.

abstract = {Injury narratives are now available real time and include useful information for injury surveillance and prevention. However, manual classification of the cause or events leading to injury found in large batches of narratives, such as workers compensation claims databases, can be prohibitive. In this study we compare the utility of four machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Single word and Bi-gram models, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) for classifying narratives into Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Injury and Illness event leading to injury classifications for a large workers compensation database. These algorithms are known to do well classifying narrative text and are fairly easy to implement with off-the-shelf software packages such as Python. We propose human-machine learning ensemble approaches which maximize the power and accuracy of the algorithms for machine-assigned codes and allow for strategic filtering of rare, emerging or ambiguous narratives for manual review. We compare human-machine approaches based on filtering on the prediction strength of the classifier vs. agreement between algorithms. Regularized Logistic Regression (LR) was the best performing algorithm alone. Using this algorithm and filtering out the bottom 30\% of predictions for manual review resulted in high accuracy (overall sensitivity/positive predictive value of 0.89) of the final machine-human coded dataset. The best pairings of algorithms included Naïve Bayes with Support Vector Machine whereby the triple ensemble NBSW=NBBI-GRAM=SVM had very high performance (0.93 overall sensitivity/positive predictive value and high accuracy (i.e. high sensitivity and positive predictive values)) across both large and small categories leaving 41\% of the narratives for manual review. Integrating LR into this ensemble mix improved performance only slightly. For large administrative datasets we propose incorporation of methods based on human-machine pairings such as we have done here, utilizing readily-available off-the-shelf machine learning techniques and resulting in only a fraction of narratives that require manual review. Human-machine ensemble methods are likely to improve performance over total manual coding.},

abstract = {Injuries at work have a substantial economic and societal burden. Often groups of labour market participants, such as young workers, recent immigrants or temporary workers are labelled as being “vulnerable” to work injury. However, defining groups in this way does little to enable a better understanding of the broader factors that place workers at increased risk of injury. In this paper we describe the development of a new measure of occupational health and safety (OH\&S) vulnerability. The purpose of this measure was to allow the identification of workers at increased risk of injury, and to enable the monitoring and surveillance of OH\&S vulnerability in the labour market. The development included a systematic literature search, and conducting focus groups with a variety of stakeholder groups, to generate a pool of potential items, followed by a series of steps to reduce these items to a more manageable pool. The final measure is 29-item instrument that captures information on four related, but distinct dimensions, thought to be associated with increased risk of injury. These dimensions are: hazard exposure; occupational health and safety policies and procedures; OH\&S awareness; and empowerment to participate in injury prevention. In a large sample of employees in Ontario and British Columbia the final measure displayed minimal missing responses, reasonably good distributions across response categories, and strong factorial validity. This new measure of OH\&S vulnerability can identify workers who are at risk of injury and provide information on the dimensions of work that may increase this risk. This measurement could be undertaken at one point in time to compare vulnerability across groups, or be undertaken at multiple time points to examine changes in dimensions of OH\&S vulnerability, for example, in response to a primary prevention intervention.},

In particular, NDS designs provide high ecological validity in the study of driver distraction. With increasing dataset sizes, current best practice of manually reviewing videos to classify the occurrence of driving behaviours, including those that are indicative of distraction, is becoming increasingly impractical. Current statistical solutions underutilise available data and create further epistemic problems. Similarly, technical solutions such as eye-tracking often require dedicated hardware that is not readily accessible or feasible to use. A computer vision solution based on open-source software was developed and tested to improve the accuracy and speed of processing NDS video data for the purpose of quantifying the occurrence of driver distraction. Using classifier cascades, manually-reviewed video data from a previously published NDS was reanalysed and used as a benchmark of current best practice for performance comparison. Two software coding systems were developed – one based on hierarchical clustering (HC), and one based on gender differences (MF). Compared to manual video coding, HC achieved 86 percent concordance, 55 percent reduction in processing time, and classified an additional 69 percent of target behaviour not previously identified through manual review. MF achieved 67 percent concordance, a 75 percent reduction in processing time, and classified an additional 35 percent of target behaviour not identified through manual review. The findings highlight the improvements in processing speed and correctly classifying target behaviours achievable through the use of custom developed computer vision solutions. Suggestions for improved system performance and wider implementation are discussed.},

Salient facts were extracted from each case, including the exact manoeuvre involved, the principle explanatory factors, the driver(s) most at fault, and the drivers' ages. Two kinds of reliability measure for case interpretations indicated high levels of consistency. Two induced exposure measures were used, comparing driver involvement in a given type of overtaking accident with involvement in overtaking accidents in general, and comparing the age profiles of the drivers most at fault with those of the other drivers involved. Ten types of overtaking accident were distinguished, and three are discussed in detail: collision with a right-turning vehicle (the most common injury-accident for overtakers), which tends to occur either because a young driver makes a faulty overtaking decision, or an older driver makes a faulty right turn; head-on collision, which affects all age groups roughly in proportion to exposure; and the `return-and-lose-control' accident, which is associated particularly with young drivers. The study illustrates the `structured judgement method' of accident causation research, in which human interpreters are used to ascribe causes and processes to individual cases, but orthodox research techniques are used to standardise procedures, and to assess and ensure reliability.},

The methodology is different from traditional non-parametric methods like classification and regression trees which develop only one model, with fixed criteria, for any given dataset. The LGP on the other hand not only evolves numerous models through the concept of biological evolution, and using the evolutionary operators of crossover and mutation, but also allows the investigator to choose the best models, developed over various runs, based on classification rates. Discipulus™ software was used to evolve the models. The results included vision obstruction which was found to be a leading factor for severe crashes. Percentage of trucks, even if small, is more likely to make the crashes injury prone. The ‘lawn and curb’ median are found to be safe for angle/turning movement crashes. Dry surface conditions as well as good pavement conditions decrease the severity of crashes and so also wider shoulder and sidewalk widths.

Previous research has shown that drowsy drivers produce systematic errors (variability) in vehicle behavior which are detectable using vehicle monitoring technology. The current study developed a new methodological approach using a vehicle heading difference metric to detect drowsy driving more effectively than other more commonly used methods. Twenty participants completed a driving scenario as well as several measures of fatigue in five testing sessions across a night of sleep deprivation. Each simulated highway driving session lasted 20min, and was analyzed for lateral lane position variability and vehicle heading difference variability with two statistical methods. Fatigue measures monitored reaction time, attention, and oculomotor movement. The results showed that examining lane heading difference using the absolute value of the raw data detected driving variability better across the night than other statistical models. The results from the fatigue measures indicated an increase in reaction time and response lapses, as well as a decrease in oculomotor reactivity across the night. These results suggest that in fatigued drivers the statistical model using the absolute value of lane heading could be an improved metric for drowsy driving detection that could accurately detect detriments in driving ability at lower levels of fatigue.},

Such systems can reduce intersection crashes and fatalities by predicting driver stop/run behavior. The research presented in this paper uses data collected from two controlled field experiments on the Smart Road at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) to model driver stop/run behavior at the onset of a yellow indication for different roadway surface conditions. The paper offers two contributions. First, it introduces a new predictor related to driver aggressiveness and demonstrates that this measure enhances the modeling of driver stop/run behavior. Second, it applies well-known artificial intelligence techniques including: adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms as well as traditional logistic regression techniques on the data in order to develop a model that can be used by traffic signal controllers to predict driver stop/run decisions in a connected vehicle environment. The research demonstrates that by adding the proposed driver aggressiveness predictor to the model, there is a statistically significant increase in the model accuracy. Moreover the false alarm rate is significantly reduced but this reduction is not statistically significant. The study demonstrates that, for the subject data, the SVM machine learning algorithm performs the best in terms of optimum classification accuracy and false positive rates. However, the SVM model produces the best performance in terms of the classification accuracy only.},

Not only is the proposed approach more effective, but it also takes into account the fuzzy rules that deal with imperfect knowledge/information and, therefore, is different from the classical Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy system, which assumes that the rule (the knowledge) is perfect. We provide an analytical solution to the practical and important problem of the conceptual probabilistic approach for formal ship safety assessment using the fuzzy set theory that involves uncertainties associated with the reliability input data. Thus, the overall safety of the ship engine is investigated as an object of risk analysis using the fuzzy mapping structure, which considers uncertainty and partial truth in the input–output mapping. The proposed method integrates direct evidence of the frame of discernment and is demonstrated through references to examples where fuzzy set models are informative. These simple applications illustrate how to assess the conflict of sensor information fusion for a sufficient cooling power system of vessels under extreme operation conditions. It was found that propulsion engine safety systems are not only a function of many environmental and operation profiles but are also dynamic and complex.},

abstract = {In-depth studies of behavioural factors in road accidents using conventional methods are often inconclusive and costly. To explore an alternative approach, 200 cross-flow junction road accidents were sampled from the files of Nottinghamshire Constabulary, England, coded for computer analysis using a specially devised ‘Traffic Related Action Analysis Language’, and then examined using a genetic algorithm (or ‘rulefinder’ program). For comparison, the same analyses were carried out on 100 descriptions of safe turns, and 100 of hypothetical accident descriptions provided by experienced drivers. A number of findings emerged, distinguishing between accidents turning onto and off major roads; those of younger and older drivers; those that resulted in injury or in damage only; and so on. The study suggests that multiple case-studies based on police case files could be very promising, provided homogeneous samples of accidents are used. Genetic algorithms could play a useful role in preliminary assessment, but an ‘information bottleneck’ remains to be overcome in capturing enough detail from each case for analysis.},

abstract = {Objective
To summarise the extent to which narrative text fields in administrative health data are used to gather information about the event resulting in presentation to a health care provider for treatment of an injury, and to highlight best practise approaches to conducting narrative text interrogation for injury surveillance purposes.
Design
Systematic review.
Data sources
Electronic databases searched included CINAHL, Google Scholar, Medline, Proquest, PubMed and PubMed Central. Snowballing strategies were employed by searching the bibliographies of retrieved references to identify relevant associated articles.
Selection criteria
Papers were selected if the study used a health-related database and if the study objectives were to a) use text field to identify injury cases or use text fields to extract additional information on injury circumstances not available from coded data or b) use text fields to assess accuracy of coded data fields for injury-related cases or c) describe methods/approaches for extracting injury information from text fields.
Methods
The papers identified through the search were independently screened by two authors for inclusion, resulting in 41 papers selected for review. Due to heterogeneity between studies meta-analysis was not performed.
Results
The majority of papers reviewed focused on describing injury epidemiology trends using coded data and text fields to supplement coded data (28 papers), with these studies demonstrating the value of text data for providing more specific information beyond what had been coded to enable case selection or provide circumstantial information. Caveats were expressed in terms of the consistency and completeness of recording of text information resulting in underestimates when using these data. Four coding validation papers were reviewed with these studies showing the utility of text data for validating and checking the accuracy of coded data. Seven studies (9 papers) described methods for interrogating injury text fields for systematic extraction of information, with a combination of manual and semi-automated methods used to refine and develop algorithms for extraction and classification of coded data from text. Quality assurance approaches to assessing the robustness of the methods for extracting text data was only discussed in 8 of the epidemiology papers, and 1 of the coding validation papers. All of the text interrogation methodology papers described systematic approaches to ensuring the quality of the approach.
Conclusions
Manual review and coding approaches, text search methods, and statistical tools have been utilised to extract data from narrative text and translate it into useable, detailed injury event information. These techniques can and have been applied to administrative datasets to identify specific injury types and add value to previously coded injury datasets. Only a few studies thoroughly described the methods which were used for text mining and less than half of the studies which were reviewed used/described quality assurance methods for ensuring the robustness of the approach. New techniques utilising semi-automated computerised approaches and Bayesian/clustering statistical methods offer the potential to further develop and standardise the analysis of narrative text for injury surveillance.},

abstract = {An important issue in road traffic safety is that drivers show adverse behavioral adaptation (BA) to driver assistance systems. Haptic steering guidance is an upcoming assistance system which facilitates lane-keeping performance while keeping drivers in the loop, and which may be particularly prone to BA. Thus far, experiments on haptic steering guidance have measured driver performance while the vehicle speed was kept constant. The aim of the present driving simulator study was to examine whether haptic steering guidance causes BA in the form of speeding, and to evaluate two types of haptic steering guidance designed not to suffer from BA. Twenty-four participants drove a 1.8m wide car for 13.9km on a curved road, with cones demarcating a single 2.2m narrow lane. Participants completed four conditions in a counterbalanced design: no guidance (Manual), continuous haptic guidance (Cont), continuous guidance that linearly reduced feedback gains from full guidance at 125km/h towards manual control at 130km/h and above (ContRF), and haptic guidance provided only when the predicted lateral position was outside a lateral bandwidth (Band). Participants were familiarized with each condition prior to the experimental runs and were instructed to drive as they normally would while minimizing the number of cone hits. Compared to Manual, the Cont condition yielded a significantly higher driving speed (on average by 7km/h), whereas ContRF and Band did not. All three guidance conditions yielded better lane-keeping performance than Manual, whereas Cont and ContRF yielded lower self-reported workload than Manual. In conclusion, continuous steering guidance entices drivers to increase their speed, thereby diminishing its potential safety benefits. It is possible to prevent BA while retaining safety benefits by making a design adjustment either in lateral (Band) or in longitudinal (ContRF) direction.},

abstract = {The duration of freeway traffic accidents duration is an important factor, which affects traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and secondary accidents. Among previous studies, the M5P algorithm has been shown to be an effective tool for predicting incident duration. M5P builds a tree-based model, like the traditional classification and regression tree (CART) method, but with multiple linear regression models as its leaves. The problem with M5P for accident duration prediction, however, is that whereas linear regression assumes that the conditional distribution of accident durations is normally distributed, the distribution for a “time-to-an-event” is almost certainly nonsymmetrical. A hazard-based duration model (HBDM) is a better choice for this kind of a “time-to-event” modeling scenario, and given this, HBDMs have been previously applied to analyze and predict traffic accidents duration. Previous research, however, has not yet applied HBDMs for accident duration prediction, in association with clustering or classification of the dataset to minimize data heterogeneity. The current paper proposes a novel approach for accident duration prediction, which improves on the original M5P tree algorithm through the construction of a M5P-HBDM model, in which the leaves of the M5P tree model are HBDMs instead of linear regression models. Such a model offers the advantage of minimizing data heterogeneity through dataset classification, and avoids the need for the incorrect assumption of normality for traffic accident durations. The proposed model was then tested on two freeway accident datasets. For each dataset, the first 500 records were used to train the following three models: (1) an M5P tree; (2) a HBDM; and (3) the proposed M5P-HBDM, and the remainder of data were used for testing. The results show that the proposed M5P-HBDM managed to identify more significant and meaningful variables than either M5P or HBDMs. Moreover, the M5P-HBDM had the lowest overall mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).},

Although the accident was formally investigated, the role of the situation awareness (SA) factor, i.e., a correct understanding of the situation, and appropriate models to maintain SA, remain unexplained. This paper extracts details of abnormal situations within the methomyl unit and models them into a situational network using dynamic Bayesian networks. A fuzzy logic system is used to resemble the operator’s thinking when confronted with these abnormal situations. The combined situational network and fuzzy logic system make it possible for the operator to assess such situations dynamically to achieve accurate SA. The findings show that the proposed structure provides a useful graphical model that facilitates the inclusion of prior background knowledge and the updating of this knowledge when new information is available from monitoring systems.},

Two in-vehicle distracter tasks were compared with an eco-driving task and a baseline task in an advanced driving simulator. N=22 subjects were asked to perform an eco-driving, CD changing, and a navigation task while engaged in critical manoeuvres during which they were expected to respond to a peripheral detection task (PDT) with total duration of 3.5h. The study involved two sessions over two consecutive days. The results show that drivers’ mental workloads are significantly higher during navigation and CD changing tasks in comparison to the two other scenarios. However, eco-driving mental workload is still marginally significant (p∼.05) across different manoeuvres. Similarly, event detection tasks show that drivers miss significantly more events in the navigation and CD changing scenarios in comparison to both the baseline and eco-driving scenario. Analysis of the practice effect shows that drivers’ baseline scenario and navigation scenario exhibit significantly less demand on the second day. Drivers also can detect significantly more events on the second day for all scenarios. The authors conclude that even reading a simple message while driving could potentially lead to missing an important event, especially when executing critical manoeuvres. However, there is some evidence of a practice effect which suggests that future research should focus on performance with habitual rather than novel tasks. It is recommended that sending text as an eco-driving message analogous to the study circumstances should not be delivered to drivers on-line when vehicle is in motion.},

The aim is to specify the situations delivered in motorcycle schools and to study the rider's activity in these situations. The methodology includes ethnographic observation within the motorcycle schools and the longitudinal monitoring of 14 trainee motorcyclists during their initial training. The training situations were described by the combination of audio–visual recordings and interviews data (i.e. concomitant or interruptive verbalization, and self-confrontation data). The results permit to (1) compare the “real” and “official” durations of track and on-road training, (2) characterize the real training situations, (3) describe the preferred forms of instruction, and (4) conduct an in-depth analysis of the situations used during training in traffic. The discussion show, in first, the poverty of the training situations which are based on the repetition of the exercises in the test, and, in second, disparities between the riding situations encountered during training and the demands made by riding in natural traffic. The usefulness and the applications of this type of approach – based on the integration of the rider's point of view notably by self-confrontation interview – for understanding real riding behaviours and how such approaches could supplement vehicle-based data are discussed in a large conclusion.},

Firstly, a heterogeneous traffic accident data set is segmented into seven clusters, which are translated into seven traffic accident types. Secondly, injury analysis is performed for each cluster. The results of these cluster-based analyses are compared with the results of a full-data analysis. This shows that applying latent class clustering as a preliminary analysis can reveal hidden relationships and can help the domain expert or traffic safety researcher to segment traffic accidents.},

abstract = {Rear-end crashes are a major type of traffic crashes in the U.S. Of practical necessity is a comprehensive examination of its mechanism that results in injuries and fatalities. Decision table (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB) methods have both been used widely but separately for solving classification problems in multiple areas except for traffic safety research. Based on a two-year rear-end crash dataset, this paper applies a decision table/Naïve Bayes (DTNB) hybrid classifier to select the deterministic attributes and predict driver injury outcomes in rear-end crashes. The test results show that the hybrid classifier performs reasonably well, which was indicated by several performance evaluation measurements, such as accuracy, F-measure, ROC, and AUC. Fifteen significant attributes were found to be significant in predicting driver injury severities, including weather, lighting conditions, road geometry characteristics, driver behavior information, etc. The extracted decision rules demonstrate that heavy vehicle involvement, a comfortable traffic environment, inferior lighting conditions, two-lane rural roadways, vehicle disabled damage, and two-vehicle crashes would increase the likelihood of drivers sustaining fatal injuries. The research limitations on data size, data structure, and result presentation are also summarized. The applied methodology and estimation results provide insights for developing effective countermeasures to alleviate rear-end crash injury severities and improve traffic system safety performance.},

Observed data include drivers’ stop/go decisions, red-light running violation, lane position in the highway, positions (leading/following) in the traffic flow, vehicle type, and vehicles’ yellow-onset speeds and distances from the intersection. Further, classification tree models were applied to analyze how the probabilities of a stop or go decision and of red-light running are associated with the traffic parameters. The data analysis indicated that vehicle's distance from the intersection at the onset of yellow, operating speed, and position in the traffic flow are the most important predictors for both the stop/go decision and red-light running violation. This study illustrates that the tree models are helpful to recognize and predict how drivers make stop/go decisions and partake in red-light running violations corresponding to the traffic parameters.},

abstract = {In the United States, 683 people were killed and an estimated 133,000 were injured in crashes due to running red lights in 2012. To help prevent/mitigate crashes caused by running red lights, these violations need to be identified before they occur, so both the road users (i.e., drivers, pedestrians, etc.) in potential danger and the infrastructure can be notified and actions can be taken accordingly. Two different data sets were used to assess the feasibility of developing red-light running (RLR) violation prediction models: (1) observational data and (2) driver simulator data. Both data sets included common factors, such as time to intersection (TTI), distance to intersection (DTI), and velocity at the onset of the yellow indication. However, the observational data set provided additional factors that the simulator data set did not, and vice versa. The observational data included vehicle information (e.g., speed, acceleration, etc.) for several different time frames. For each vehicle approaching an intersection in the observational data set, required data were extracted from several time frames as the vehicle drew closer to the intersection. However, since the observational data were inherently anonymous, driver factors such as age and gender were unavailable in the observational data set. Conversely, the simulator data set contained age and gender. In addition, the simulator data included a secondary (non-driving) task factor and a treatment factor (i.e., incoming/outgoing calls while driving). The simulator data only included vehicle information for certain time frames (e.g., yellow onset); the data did not provide vehicle information for several different time frames while vehicles were approaching an intersection. In this study, the random forest (RF) machine-learning technique was adopted to develop RLR violation prediction models. Factor importance was obtained for different models and different data sets to show how differently the factors influence the performance of each model. A sensitivity analysis showed that the factor importance to identify RLR violations changed when data from different time frames were used to develop the prediction models. TTI, DTI, the required deceleration parameter (RDP), and velocity at the onset of a yellow indication were among the most important factors identified by both models constructed using observational data and simulator data. Furthermore, in addition to the factors obtained from a point in time (i.e., yellow onset), valuable information suitable for RLR violation prediction was obtained from defined monitoring periods. It was found that period lengths of 2–6m contributed to the best model performance.},

abstract = {Forty-two licensed drivers were tested in an experiment that required them to respond to an in-vehicle phone at the same time that they were faced with making a crucial stopping decision. Using test track facilities, we also examined the influence of driver gender and driver age on these dual-task response capacities. Each driver was given task practice and then performed a first block of 24 trials, where one trial represented one circuit of the test track. Half of the trials were control conditions in which neither the stop-light was activated nor was the in-vehicle phone triggered. Four trials required only stop-light response and a further four, phone response only. The remaining four trials required the driver to complete each task simultaneously. The order of presentation of specific trials was randomized and the whole sequence was repeated in a second block giving 48 trials per driver. In-vehicle phone response also contained an embedded memory task that was evaluated at the end of each trial circuit. Results confirmed our previous observation that in the dual-task condition there was a slower response to the light change. To compensate for this slowed response, drivers subsequently brake more intensely. Most importantly, we recorded a critical 15\% increase in non-response to the stop-light in the presence of the phone distraction task which equates with increased stop-light violations on the open road. These response patterns varied by driver age and driver gender. In particular, age had a large effect on task components that required speed of response to multiple, simultaneous demands. Since driving represents a highly complex and interactive environment, it is not possible to specify a simplistic relationship between these distraction effects and outcome crash patterns. However, we can conclude that such in-vehicle technologies erode performance safety margin and distract drivers from their critical primary task of vehicle control. As such it can be anticipated that a causal relation exists to collision events. This is a crucial concern for all in-vehicle device designers and for the many safety researchers and professionals seeking to reduce the adverse impacts of vehicle collisions.},

This is highlighted by the large number of interventions developed for older adults with the goal of maintaining such mobility. The current paper reviews the state of the science with respect to mobility interventions. Inclusion criteria for the review were: (1) articles must have been peer-reviewed; (2) interventions were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT); (3) studies included a mobility outcome such as lifespace, driving, or walking ability; (4) studies included a sample of healthy community-dwelling older adults (e.g., not investigations of disease conditions); and (5) studies must have reported enough empirical data and detail such that results could potentially be replicated. Three main types of interventions were identified: cognitive training, educational interventions, and exercise interventions. A detailed summary and evaluation of each type of intervention, and the current evidence regarding its effectiveness in maintaining mobility, are discussed. Several interventions show clear evidence of effectiveness, and thus are prime areas for translation of results to the older population.

abstract = {Factor complexity is a characteristic of traffic crashes. This paper proposes a novel method, namely boosted regression trees (BRT), to investigate the complex and nonlinear relationships in high-variance traffic crash data. The Taiwanese 2004–2005 single-vehicle motorcycle crash data are used to demonstrate the utility of BRT. Traditional logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) models are also used to compare their estimation results and external validities. Both the in-sample cross-validation and out-of-sample validation results show that an increase in tree complexity provides improved, although declining, classification performance, indicating a limited factor complexity of single-vehicle motorcycle crashes. The effects of crucial variables including geographical, time, and sociodemographic factors explain some fatal crashes. Relatively unique fatal crashes are better approximated by interactive terms, especially combinations of behavioral factors. BRT models generally provide improved transferability than conventional logistic regression and CART models. This study also discusses the implications of the results for devising safety policies.},

abstract = {The aim of the reported research was to examine the perceptions of road user safety amongst different road users and examine the link between attitudes, empathy and skill in motorcycle safety behaviour. Motorcyclists were perceived by the study participants, members of the public at four different locations at the UK (including motorcyclists and non-motorcyclists), as a group be at a high risk of accidents on the road. This was due to perceived behavioural characteristics of motorcyclists – who were viewed as ‘thrill seekers’ – as well as observed behaviours on the road. This, coupled with the physical vulnerability and excessive speeds, meant that motorbike driving was considered by the study participants as the least safe form of road use. There was broad agreement that motorcycling was dangerous as a whole, but not all motorcyclists were necessarily risky riders. The issue of ‘competitive space’ emerged between car drivers and motorcyclists in particular and it was suggested that there was a lack of mutual awareness and considerations between the two groups. Generally, greatest empathy comes from drivers who are motorcyclists themselves. Engineering, education, enforcement interventions were investigated. These were aimed at two main areas: normalising safer driving behaviours for motorcyclists and increasing awareness of bikes for motorists—particularly in relation to reducing speed limits at urban junctions. Finally, the idea of risk mapping and reduced speed limits on rural roads was seen as potentially effective—particularly as certain motorcyclists highlighted that they changed their riding behaviours by increasing speed and taking greater risks on these roads.},

Based on the requirements analysis for identifying precursor and the discussion of enabling technology solutions for acquiring and sharing real-time automatic identification information on construction site, this paper proposes an identification system design for proactive accident prevention to improve construction site safety. Firstly, a case study is conducted to analyze the automatic identification requirements for identifying accident precursors in construction site. Results show that it mainly consists of three aspects, namely access control, training and inspection information and operation authority. The system is then designed to fulfill these requirements based on ZigBee enabled wireless sensor network (WSN), radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and an integrated ZigBee RFID sensor network structure. At the same time, an information database is also designed and implemented, which includes 15 tables, 54 queries and several reports and forms. In the end, a demonstration system based on the proposed system design is developed as a proof of concept prototype. The contributions of this study include the requirement analysis and technical design of a real-time identity information tracking solution for proactive accident prevention on construction sites. The technical solution proposed in this paper has a significant importance in improving safety performance on construction sites. Moreover, this study can serve as a reference design for future system integrations where more functions, such as environment monitoring and location tracking, can be added.},

Cars and motorcycles are particularly prone to this. Insight is provided in this paper by a naturalistic method using concurrent verbal protocols and an automatic, highly reliable semantic network creation tool. The method shows how the same road situation is interpreted differently by car drivers and motorcyclists in ways congruent with wider accident rates. Analysis of the structure and content of the semantic networks reveals a greater degree of cognitive compatibility on faster roads such as motorways, but evidence of more critical incompatibilities on country roads and junctions. Both of these road types are implicated in helping to activate cognitive schema which in turn generate stereotypical behaviors unfavourable to the anticipation of motorcyclists by car drivers. The results are discussed in terms of practical measures such as road signs which warn of events behind as well as in front, cross-mode training and the concept of route driveability.},

This study explores the drivers, vehicles, and environments’ characteristics associated with crash avoidance maneuvers (i.e., evasive actions or no evasive actions). Rear-end collisions, head-on collisions, and angle collisions are analyzed separately using decision trees and the significance of the variables on the binary response variable (evasive actions or no evasive actions) is determined. Moreover, the random forests method is employed to rank the importance of the drivers/vehicles/environments characteristics on crash avoidance maneuvers. According to the exploratory analyses’ results, drivers’ visibility obstruction, drivers’ physical impairment, drivers’ distraction are associated with crash avoidance maneuvers in all three types of accidents. Moreover, speed limit is associated with rear-end collisions’ avoidance maneuvers and vehicle type is correlated with head-on collisions and angle collisions’ avoidance maneuvers. It is recommended that future research investigates further the explored trends (e.g., physically impaired drivers, visibility obstruction) using driving simulators which may help in legislative initiatives and in-vehicle technology recommendations.},

Their ‘to do or not to do’ choices in conditions of four (out of a total of six) traffic dilemmas (amber light, distance keeping, stopping in road-crossing and merging in routes) were analyzable in terms of a modification of the paradigm of signal detection. In accord with the basics of the paradigm of signal detection, the rate of success of the drivers to detect signals of danger on the road (perceptual sensitivity) fell into the range of partial uncertainty (more than 50\% and not too much above this level)! The choices made by thrill-and-adventure-seeking drivers were more lenient than the choices of the drivers who scored lower on this dimension.},

To consider the nonlinearity in crash predictors, the study develops generalized nonlinear models (GNMs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models. The MARS is one of the promising data mining techniques due to its ability to consider the interaction impact of more than one variables and nonlinearity of predictors simultaneously. The CMFs were developed for four roadside elements (driveway density, poles density, distance to poles, and distance to trees) and combined safety effects of multiple treatments were interpreted by the interaction terms from the MARS models. Five years of crash data from 2008 to 2012 were collected for rural undivided four-lane roadways in Florida for different crash types and severity levels. The results show that the safety effects decrease as density of driveways and roadside poles increase. The estimated CMFs also indicate that increasing distance to roadside poles and trees reduces crashes. The study demonstrates that the GNMs show slightly better model fitness than negative binomial (NB) models. Moreover, the MARS models outperformed NB and GNM models due to its strength to reflect the nonlinearity of crash predictors and interaction impacts among variables under different ranges. Therefore, it can be recommended that the CMFs are estimated using MARS when there are nonlinear relationships between crash rate and roadway characteristics, and interaction impacts among multiple treatments.},

Inexperienced, low mileage drivers had on average approximately 250milliseconds (ms) longer reaction times to a peripheral stimulus, than the experienced drivers. It would, therefore, appear that drivers with better training and experience were able to automate the driving task more effectively than their less experienced counterparts in accordance with theoretical psychological models. It has been suggested that increased training and experience may provide attention resource savings that can benefit the driver in handling new or unexpected traffic situations.},

abstract = {Cooperative warning systems have a great potential to prevent traffic accidents. However, because of their predictive nature, they might also go along with an increased frequency of incorrect alarms that could limit their effectiveness. To better understand the consequences associated with incorrect alarms, a driving simulator study with N=80 drivers was conducted to investigate how situational context and warning urgency jointly influence drivers’ compliance with an unreliable advisory warning system (AWS). The participants encountered several critical urban driving situations and were either assisted by a 100\% reliable AWS, a 60\% reliable AWS that generated false alarms (without obvious reason) or a 60\% reliable AWS that generated unnecessary alarms (with plausible reason). A baseline drive without any assistance was also introduced to the study. The warnings were presented either only visually or visual-auditory. In line with previous research, drivers’ compliance and effectiveness of the AWS was reduced by false alarms but not by unnecessary alarms. However, this so-called cry wolf effect (Breznitz, 1984) was only found in the visual-auditory condition, whereas there was no effect of warning reliability in the condition with visual AWS. Furthermore, false but not unnecessary alarms caused the participants to rate the AWS less favourably during a follow-up interview. In spite of these negative effects of false alarms, a reduction in the frequency of safety-critical events (SCEs) and an earlier braking onset were evident in all assisted drives compared with that of non-assisted driving, even when the AWS was unreliable. The results may thus lower concerns about the negative consequences of warning drivers unnecessarily about upcoming traffic conflicts if the reasons of these alarms are comprehensible. From a perspective of designing AWS, we recommend to use less urgent warnings to prevent the cry wolf effect.},

Based on crash data collected at 326 freeway diverge areas, a SVM model was developed for predicting the injury severity associated with individual crashes. An ordered probit (OP) model was also developed using the same dataset. The research team compared the performance of the SVM model and the OP model. It was found that the SVM model produced better prediction performance for crash injury severity than did the OP model. The percent of correct prediction for the SVM model was found to be 48.8\%, which was higher than that produced by the OP model (44.0\%). Even though the SVM model may suffer from the multi-class classification problem, it still provides better prediction results for small proportion injury severities than the OP model does. The research also investigated the potential of using the SVM model for evaluating the impacts of external factors on crash injury severities. The sensitivity analysis results show that the SVM model produced comparable results regarding the impacts of variables on crash injury severity as compared to the OP model. For several variables such as the length of the exit ramp and the shoulder width of the freeway mainline, the results of the SVM model are more reasonable than those of the OP model.},

It is important to investigate the factors that affect rollover crashes and their influence on driver injury severity outcomes. This study employs support vector machine (SVM) models to investigate driver injury severity patterns in rollover crashes based on two-year crash data gathered in New Mexico. The impacts of various explanatory variables are examined in terms of crash and environmental information, vehicle features, and driver demographics and behavior characteristics. A classification and regression tree (CART) model is utilized to identify significant variables and SVM models with polynomial and Gaussian radius basis function (RBF) kernels are used for model performance evaluation. It is shown that the SVM models produce reasonable prediction performance and the polynomial kernel outperforms the Gaussian RBF kernel. Variable impact analysis reveals that factors including comfortable driving environment conditions, driver alcohol or drug involvement, seatbelt use, number of travel lanes, driver demographic features, maximum vehicle damages in crashes, crash time, and crash location are significantly associated with driver incapacitating injuries and fatalities. These findings provide insights for better understanding rollover crash causes and the impacts of various explanatory factors on driver injury severity patterns.},

While there is a strong emphasis for older people to maintain their mobility, the safety of older drivers is a serious community concern. Frailty and declines in a range of age-related sensory, cognitive, and physical impairments can place older drivers at an increased risk of crash-related injuries and death. A number of studies have indicated that in-vehicle technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVIS) may provide assistance to older drivers. However, these technologies will only benefit older drivers if their design is congruent with the complex needs and diverse abilities of this driving cohort. The design of ADAS and IVIS is largely informed by automotive Human Machine Interface (HMI) guidelines. However, it is unclear to what extent the declining sensory, cognitive and physical capabilities of older drivers are addressed in the current guidelines. This paper provides a review of key current design guidelines for IVIS and ADAS with respect to the extent they address age-related changes in functional capacities. The review revealed that most of the HMI guidelines do not address design issues related to older driver impairments. In fact, in many guidelines driver age and sensory cognitive and physical impairments are not mentioned at all and where reference is made, it is typically very broad. Prescriptive advice on how to actually design a system so that it addresses the needs and limitations of older drivers is not provided. In order for older drivers to reap the full benefits that in-vehicle technology can afford, it is critical that further work establish how older driver limitations and capabilities can be supported by the system design process, including their inclusion into HMI design guidelines.},

abstract = {Traffic accidents data sets are usually imbalanced, where the number of instances classified under the killed or severe injuries class (minority) is much lower than those classified under the slight injuries class (majority). This, however, supposes a challenging problem for classification algorithms and may cause obtaining a model that well cover the slight injuries instances whereas the killed or severe injuries instances are misclassified frequently. Based on traffic accidents data collected on urban and suburban roads in Jordan for three years (2009–2011); three different data balancing techniques were used: under-sampling which removes some instances of the majority class, oversampling which creates new instances of the minority class and a mix technique that combines both. In addition, different Bayes classifiers were compared for the different imbalanced and balanced data sets: Averaged One-Dependence Estimators, Weightily Average One-Dependence Estimators, and Bayesian networks in order to identify factors that affect the severity of an accident. The results indicated that using the balanced data sets, especially those created using oversampling techniques, with Bayesian networks improved classifying a traffic accident according to its severity and reduced the misclassification of killed and severe injuries instances. On the other hand, the following variables were found to contribute to the occurrence of a killed causality or a severe injury in a traffic accident: number of vehicles involved, accident pattern, number of directions, accident type, lighting, surface condition, and speed limit. This work, to the knowledge of the authors, is the first that aims at analyzing historical data records for traffic accidents occurring in Jordan and the first to apply balancing techniques to analyze injury severity of traffic accidents.},

abstract = {Aim of the study was the analysis of powered two-wheeler (PTW) crashes in Italy in order to detect interdependence as well as dissimilarities among crash characteristics and provide insights for the development of safety improvement strategies focused on PTWs. At this aim, data mining techniques were used to analyze the data relative to the 254,575 crashes involving PTWs occurred in Italy in the period 2006–2008. Classification trees analysis and rules discovery were performed. Tree-based methods are non-linear and non-parametric data mining tools for supervised classification and regression problems. They do not require a priori probabilistic knowledge about the phenomena under studying and consider conditional interactions among input data. Rules discovery is the identification of sets of items (i.e., crash patterns) that occur together in a given event (i.e., a crash in our study) more often than they would if they were independent of each other. Thus, the method can detect interdependence among crash characteristics. Due to the large number of patterns considered, both methods suffer from an extreme risk of finding patterns that appear due to chance alone. To overcome this problem, in our study we randomly split the sample data in two data sets and used well-established statistical practices to evaluate the statistical significance of the results. Both the classification trees and the rules discovery were effective in providing meaningful insights about PTW crash characteristics and their interdependencies. Even though in several cases different crash characteristics were highlighted, the results of the two the analysis methods were never contradictory. Furthermore, most of the findings of this study were consistent with the results of previous studies which used different analytical techniques, such as probabilistic models of crash injury severity. Basing on the analysis results, engineering countermeasures and policy initiatives to reduce PTW injuries and fatalities were singled out. The simultaneous use of classification trees and association discovery must not, however, be seen as an attempt to supplant other techniques, but as a complementary method which can be integrated into other safety analyses.},

A driving simulation experiment was designed and conducted using 32 participant drivers. Collected data included the continuous driving time before detection of drowsiness and virtual LBS data related to temperature, time of day, lane width, average travel speed, driving time in heavy traffic, and driving time on different roadway types. Demographic information, such as nap habit, age, gender, and driving experience was also collected through questionnaires distributed to the participants. An Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model was developed to estimate the driving time before detection of drowsiness. The results of the AFT model showed driving time before drowsiness was longer during the day than at night, and was longer at lower temperatures. Additionally, drivers who identified as having a nap habit were more vulnerable to drowsiness. Generally, higher average travel speeds were correlated to a higher risk of drowsy driving, as were longer periods of low-speed driving in traffic jam conditions. Considering different road types, drivers felt drowsy more quickly on freeways compared to other facilities. The proposed model provides a better understanding of how driver drowsiness is influenced by different environmental and demographic factors. The model can be used to provide real-time data for the LBS-based drowsy driving warning system, improving past methods based only on a fixed driving.},

abstract = {This study aimed to develop a real-time crash risk model with limited data in China by using Bayesian meta-analysis and Bayesian inference approach. A systematic review was first conducted by using three different Bayesian meta-analyses, including the fixed effect meta-analysis, the random effect meta-analysis, and the meta-regression. The meta-analyses provided a numerical summary of the effects of traffic variables on crash risks by quantitatively synthesizing results from previous studies. The random effect meta-analysis and the meta-regression produced a more conservative estimate for the effects of traffic variables compared with the fixed effect meta-analysis. Then, the meta-analyses results were used as informative priors for developing crash risk models with limited data. Three different meta-analyses significantly affect model fit and prediction accuracy. The model based on meta-regression can increase the prediction accuracy by about 15\% as compared to the model that was directly developed with limited data. Finally, the Bayesian predictive densities analysis was used to identify the outliers in the limited data. It can further improve the prediction accuracy by 5.0\%.},

An on-site driving experiment was conducted on a national highway in Hiroshima City, Japan, by involving 14 university students, and it was demonstrated that dynamic information seems more effective for drivers to avoid dangerous driving situations than static information. It was also found that having only the voice-based warning information may be as effective as having both the voice and image warning information.},

abstract = {Crash risk prediction models were developed to link safety to various phases and phase transitions defined by the three phase traffic theory. Results of the Bayesian conditional logit analysis showed that different traffic states differed distinctly with respect to safety performance. The random-parameter logit approach was utilized to account for the heterogeneity caused by unobserved factors. The Bayesian inference approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used for the estimation of the random-parameter logit model. The proposed approach increased the prediction performance of the crash risk models as compared with the conventional logit model. The three phase traffic theory can help us better understand the mechanism of crash occurrences in various traffic states. The contributing factors to crash likelihood can be well explained by the mechanism of phase transitions. We further discovered that the free flow state can be divided into two sub-phases on the basis of safety performance, including a true free flow state in which the interactions between vehicles are minor, and a platooned traffic state in which bunched vehicles travel in successions. The results of this study suggest that a safety perspective can be added to the three phase traffic theory. The results also suggest that the heterogeneity between different traffic states should be considered when estimating the risks of crash occurrences on freeways.},

abstract = {Recent decades have seen considerable growth in computer capabilities, data collection technology and communication mediums. This growth has had considerable impact on our ability to replicate driver behaviour and understand the processes involved in failures in the traffic system. From time to time it is necessary to assess the level of development as a basis of determining how far we have come. This paper sets out to assess the state of the art in the use of computer models to simulate and assess the level of safety in existing and future traffic systems. It reviews developments in the area of road safety simulation models. In particular, it reviews computer models of driver and vehicle behaviour within a road context. It focuses on stochastic numerical models of traffic behaviour and how reliable these are in estimating levels of safety on the traffic network. Models of this type are commonly used in the assessment of traffic systems for capacity, delay and general performance. Adding safety to this assessment regime may allow more comprehensive assessment of future traffic systems. To date the models have focused primarily on vehicular traffic that is, cars and heavy vehicles. It has been shown that these models have potential in measuring the level of conflict on parts of the network and the measure of conflict correlated well with crash statistics. Interest in the prediction of crashes and crash severity is growing and new models are focusing on the continuum of general traffic conditions, conflict, severe conflict, crash and severe crashes. The paper also explores the general data types used to develop, calibrate and validate these models. Recent technological development in in-vehicle data collection, driver simulators and machine learning offers considerable potential for improving the behavioural base, rigour and application of road safety simulation models. The paper closes with some indication of areas of future development.},

This paper describes the impact of an auditory secondary task on drivers’ mental states during a primary driving task. N=20 participants performed the test procedure in a car following task with repeated forced braking on a non-public test track. Performance measures (provoked reaction time to brake lights) and brain activity (EEG alpha spindles) were analyzed to describe distracted drivers. Further, a classification approach was used to investigate whether alpha spindles can predict drivers’ mental states. Results show that reaction times and alpha spindle rate increased with time-on-task. Moreover, brake reaction times and alpha spindle rate were significantly higher while driving with auditory secondary task opposed to driving only. In single-trial classification, a combination of spindle parameters yielded a median classification error of about 8\% in discriminating the distracted from the alert driving. Reduced driving performance (i.e., prolonged brake reaction times) during increased cognitive load is assumed to be indicated by EEG alpha spindles, enabling the quantification of driver distraction in experiments on public roads without verbally assessing the drivers’ mental states.},

Forty participants (20 novice, 20 experienced) completed simulated rides in urban and rural scenarios while responding to a safety-critical peripheral detection task (PDT). Results showed a significant increase in the standard deviation of lateral position in the urban scenario and PDT reaction time in the rural scenario under 0.05\% BAC compared with zero alcohol. Participants were most likely to collide with an unexpected pedestrian in the urban scenario at 0.02\% BAC, with novice participants at a greater relative risk than experienced riders. Novices chose to ride faster than experienced participants in the rural scenario regardless of BAC. Not all results were significant, emphasising the complex situation of the effects of low dose BAC on riding performance, which needs further research.

Respondents completed two postal surveys, separated by about 6 months, that included items relating to their crash history, riding patterns, characteristics of their motorcycle, and its odometer reading. Odometer readings indicated that respondents rode a mean of 5208km each year, and that annual exposure was related to gender, motorcycle type, and dominant riding location, time of week, and purpose. The amount of riding reported for different purposes changed with age, with older riders more likely than younger riders to ride for recreational reasons and on weekends. The mean crash rate (based on self-reported crash involvement) was 0.96 crashes/100,000km. The crash rate declined with age, was highest in the Sydney metropolitan area, was lowest for motorcycles with large engines, and was highest for trail and dual-use motorcycles. There was a relationship between annual exposure and crash risk such that riders who rode relatively little had higher crash risks (per 100,000km travelled) than riders who rode more often. A cluster analysis identified three groups of riders with higher-than-average risks of crash involvement.},

This reveals the wider context of the road transport system operating under the current laws using an Accimap analysis. A distinction in the law between the use of hand-held mobile phones, a device that is typically banned for use by drivers worldwide, and the use of other technological devices that are covered by more general laws against ‘careless’ and/or ‘dangerous’ driving was found.

Methods: This study used injury narratives and corresponding E-codes assigned by experts from the 1997 and 1998 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). A Fuzzy Bayesian model was used to assign injury descriptions to 13 E-code categories. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were measured by comparing the computer generated codes with E-code categories assigned by experts. Results: The computer program correctly classified 4695 (82.7\%) of the 5677 injury narratives when multiple words were included as keywords in the model. The use of multiple-word predictors compared with using single words alone improved both the sensitivity and specificity of the computer generated codes. The program is capable of identifying and filtering out cases that would benefit most from manual coding. For example, the program could be used to code the narrative if the maximum probability of a category given the keywords in the narrative was at least 0.9. If the maximum probability was lower than 0.9 (which will be the case for approximately 33\% of the narratives) the case would be filtered out for manual review. Conclusions: A computer program based on Fuzzy Bayes logic is capable of accurately categorizing cause-of-injury codes from injury narratives. The capacity to filter out certain cases for manual coding improves the utility of this process.},

The safety professionals generally tend to heavily rely on their own past experiences to make subjective decisions on risk assessment without systematic decision making. Indeed, understanding of the underlying principles of risk assessment is significant. In this study, the qualitative analysis on the safety professionals’ beliefs of risk assessment and their perceptions towards risk assessment, including their recognitions of possible accident causes, the degree of differentiations on their perceptions of risk levels of different trades of works, recognitions of the occurrence of different types of accidents, and their inter-relationships with safety performance in terms of accident rates will be explored in the Stage 1. At the second stage, the deficiencies of the current general practice for risk assessment can be sorted out firstly. Based on the findings from Stage 1 and the historical accident data from 15 large-scaled construction projects in 3-year average, a risk evaluation model prioritizing the risk levels of different trades of works and which cause different types of site accident due to various accident causes will be developed quantitatively. With the suggested systematic accident recording techniques, this model can be implemented in the construction industry at both project level and organizational level. The model (Q2REM) not only act as a useful supplementary guideline of risk assessment for the construction safety professionals, but also assists them to pinpoint the potential risks on site for the construction workers under respective trades of works through safety trainings and education. It, in turn, arouses their awareness on safety risk. As the Q2REM can clearly show the potential accident causes leading to different types of accident by trade of works, it helps the concerned safety professionals and parties to plan effective accident prevention measures with reference to the priority of the risk levels.},

To reduce the risk of injuries during these common impact scenarios, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is developing new safety standards for spaceflight. The Test Device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) advanced multi-directional anthropomorphic test device (ATD), with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration modification kit, has been chosen to evaluate occupant spacecraft safety because of its improved biofidelity. NASA tested the THOR ATD at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) in various impact configurations, including frontal and spinal loading. A computational finite element model (FEM) of the THOR to match these latest modifications was developed in LS-DYNA software. The main goal of this study was to calibrate and validate the THOR FEM for use in future spacecraft safety studies. An optimization-based method was developed to calibrate the material models of the lumbar joints and pelvic flesh. Compression test data were used to calibrate the quasi-static material properties of the pelvic flesh, while whole body THOR ATD kinematic and kinetic responses under spinal and frontal loading conditions were used for dynamic calibration. The performance of the calibrated THOR FEM was evaluated by simulating separate THOR ATD tests with different crash pulses along both spinal and frontal directions. The model response was compared with test data by calculating its correlation score using the CORrelation and Analysis rating system. The biofidelity of the THOR FEM was then evaluated against tests recorded on human volunteers under 3 different frontal and spinal impact pulses. The calibrated THOR FEM responded with high similarity to the THOR ATD in all validation tests. The THOR FEM showed good biofidelity relative to human-volunteer data under spinal loading, but limited biofidelity under frontal loading. This may suggest a need for further improvements in both the THOR ATD and FEM. Overall, results presented in this study provide confidence in the THOR FEM for use in predicting THOR ATD responses for conditions, such as those observed in spacecraft landing, and for use in evaluating THOR ATD biofidelity.},

The aims of this study are summarized into two aspects: (1) to cluster different driving-risk levels involved in near-crashes, and (2) to unveil the factors that greatly influence the driving-risk level. A novel method to quantify the driving-risk level of a near-crash scenario is proposed by clustering the braking process characteristics, namely maximum deceleration, average deceleration, and percentage reduction in vehicle kinetic energy. A classification and regression tree (CART) is employed to unveil the relationship among driving risk, driver/vehicle characteristics, and road environment. The results indicate that the velocity when braking, triggering factors, potential object type, and potential crash type exerted the greatest influence on the driving-risk levels in near-crashes.},

Moreover, these studies mostly focused on estimating the models but barely investigated the models’ predictive abilities. In this study, support vector machine (SVM), a recently proposed statistical learning model was introduced to evaluate real-time crash risk. The data has been split into a training dataset (used for developing the models) and scoring datasets (meant for assessing the models’ predictive power). Classification and regression tree (CART) model has been developed to select the most important explanatory variables and based on the results, three candidates Bayesian logistic regression models have been estimated with accounting for different levels unobserved heterogeneity. Then SVM models with different kernel functions have been developed and compared to the Bayesian logistic regression model. Model comparisons based on areas under the ROC curve (AUC) demonstrated that the SVM model with Radial-basis kernel function outperformed the others. Moreover, several extension analyses have been conducted to evaluate the effect of sample size on SVM models’ predictive capability; the importance of variable selection before developing SVM models; and the effect of the explanatory variables in the SVM models. Results indicate that (1) smaller sample size would enhance the SVM model's classification accuracy, (2) variable selection procedure is needed prior to the SVM model estimation, and (3) explanatory variables have identical effects on crash occurrence for the SVM models and logistic regression models.},

abstract = {Background
While helmet usage is often mandated, few motorcycle and scooter riders make full use of protection for the rest of the body. Little is known about the factors associated with riders’ usage or non-usage of protective clothing.
Methods
Novice riders were surveyed prior to their provisional licence test in NSW, Australia. Questions related to usage and beliefs about protective clothing, riding experience and exposure, risk taking and demographic details. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to identify factors associated with two measures of usage, comparing those who sometimes vs rarely/never rode unprotected and who usually wore non-motorcycle pants vs motorcycle pants.
Results
Ninety-four percent of eligible riders participated and usable data was obtained from 66\% (n=776). Factors significantly associated with riding unprotected were: youth (17–25 years) (RR=2.00, 95\% CI: 1.50–2.65), not seeking protective clothing information (RR=1.29, 95\% CI=1.07–1.56), non-usage in hot weather (RR=3.01, 95\% CI: 2.38–3.82), awareness of social pressure to wear more protection (RR=1.48, 95\% CI: 1.12–1.95), scepticism about protective benefits (RR=2.00, 95\% CI: 1.22–3.28) and riding a scooter vs any type of motorcycle. A similar cluster of factors including youth (RR=1.17, 95\% CI: 1.04–1.32), social pressure (RR=1.32, 95\% CI: 1.16–1.50), hot weather (RR=1.30, 95\% CI: 1.19–1.41) and scooter vs motorcycles were also associated with wearing non-motorcycle pants. There was no evidence of an association between use of protective clothing and other indicators of risk taking behaviour.
Conclusions
Factors strongly associated with non-use of protective clothing include not having sought information about protective clothing and not believing in its injury reduction value. Interventions to increase use may therefore need to focus on development of credible information sources about crash risk and the benefits of protective clothing. Further work is required to develop motorcycle protective clothing suitable for hot climates.},

abstract = {Crash prediction models have been very popular in highway safety analyses. However, in highway safety research, the prediction of outcomes is seldom, if ever, the only research objective when estimating crash prediction models. Only very few existing methods can be used to efficiently predict motor vehicle crashes. Thus, there is a need to examine new methods for better predicting motor vehicle crashes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for predicting motor vehicle crashes. SVM models, which are based on the statistical learning theory, are a new class of models that can be used for predicting values. To accomplish the objective of this study, Negative Binomial (NB) regression and SVM models were developed and compared using data collected on rural frontage roads in Texas. Several models were estimated using different sample sizes. The study shows that SVM models predict crash data more effectively and accurately than traditional NB models. In addition, SVM models do not over-fit the data and offer similar, if not better, performance than Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models documented in previous research. Given this characteristic and the fact that SVM models are faster to implement than BPNN models, it is suggested to use these models if the sole purpose of the study consists of predicting motor vehicle crashes.},

abstract = {In the public schools of many developing countries, numerous accidents and incidents occur because of poor safety regulations and management systems. To improve the educational environment in Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Education seeks novel approaches to measure school safety performance in order to decrease incidents and accidents. The main objective of this research was to develop a systematic approach for measuring Saudi school safety performance using the balanced scorecard framework philosophy. The evolved third generation balanced scorecard framework is considered to be a suitable and robust framework that captures the system-wide leading and lagging indicators of business performance. The balanced scorecard architecture is ideal for adaptation to complex areas such as safety management where a holistic system evaluation is more effective than traditional compartmentalised approaches. In developing the safety performance balanced scorecard for Saudi schools, the conceptual framework was first developed and peer-reviewed by eighteen Saudi education experts. Next, 200 participants, including teachers, school executives, and Ministry of Education officers, were recruited to rate both the importance and the performance of 79 measurement items used in the framework. Exploratory factor analysis, followed by the confirmatory partial least squares method, was then conducted in order to operationalise the safety performance balanced scorecard, which encapsulates the following five salient perspectives: safety management and leadership; safety learning and training; safety policy, procedures and processes; workforce safety culture; and safety performance. Partial least squares based structural equation modelling was then conducted to reveal five significant relationships between perspectives, namely, safety management and leadership had a significant effect on safety learning and training and safety policy, procedures and processes, both safety learning and training and safety policy, procedures and processes had significant effects on workforce safety culture, and workforce safety culture had a significant effect on safety performance.},

For the purposes of this review fatigue was defined as ‘a biological drive for recuperative rest’. The review examined the relationship between three major causes of fatigue – sleep homeostasis factors, circadian influences and nature of task effects – and safety outcomes, first looking at accidents and injury and then at adverse effects on performance. The review demonstrated clear evidence for sleep homeostatic effects producing impaired performance and accidents. Nature of task effects, especially tasks requiring sustained attention and monotony, also produced significant performance decrements, but the effects on accidents and/or injury were unresolved because of a lack of studies. The evidence did not support a direct link between circadian-related fatigue influences and performance or safety outcomes and further research is needed to clarify the link. Undoubtedly, circadian variation plays some role in safety outcomes, but the evidence suggests that these effects reflect a combination of time of day and sleep-related factors. Similarly, although some measures of performance show a direct circadian component, others would appear to only do so in combination with sleep-related factors. The review highlighted gaps in the literature and opportunities for further research.},

abstract = {Background
The intelligent speeding prediction system (ISPS) is an in-vehicle speed assistance system developed to provide quantitative predictions of speeding. Although the ISPS's prediction of speeding has been validated, whether the ISPS can regulate a driver's speed behavior or whether a driver accepts the ISPS needs further investigation. Additionally, compared to the existing intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) system, whether the ISPS performs better in terms of reducing excessive speeds and improving driving safety needs more direct evidence.
Objectives
An experiment was conducted to assess and compare the effectiveness and acceptance of the ISPS and the ISA.
Method
We conducted a driving simulator study with 40 participants. System type served as a between-subjects variable with four levels: no speed assistance system, pre-warning system developed based on the ISPS, post-warning system ISA, and combined pre-warning and ISA system. Speeding criterion served as a within-subjects variable with two levels: lower (posted speed limit plus 1mph) and higher (posted speed limit plus 5mph) speed threshold. Several aspects of the participants’ driving speed, speeding measures, lead vehicle response, and subjective measures were collected.
Results
Both pre-warning and combined systems led to greater minimum time-to-collision. The combined system resulted in slower driving speed, fewer speeding exceedances, shorter speeding duration, and smaller speeding magnitude.
Conclusions
The results indicate that both pre-warning and combined systems have the potential to improve driving safety and performance.},

abstract = {Urban expressways play a vital role in the modern mega cities by serving peak hour traffic alongside reducing travel time for moderate to long distance intra-city trips. Thus, ensuring safety on these roads holds high priority. Little knowledge has been acquired till date regarding crash mechanism on these roads. This study uses high-resolution traffic data collected from the detectors to identify factors influencing crash. It also identifies traffic patterns associated with different types of crashes and explains crash phenomena thereby. Unlike most of the previous studies on conventional expressways, the research separately investigates the basic freeway segments (BFS) and the ramp areas. The study employs random multinomial logit, a random forest of logit models, to rank the variables; expectation maximization clustering algorithm to identify crash prone traffic patterns and classification and regression trees to explain crash phenomena. As accentuated by the study outcome, crash mechanism is not generic throughout the expressway and it varies from the BFS to the ramp vicinities. The level of congestion and speed difference between upstream and downstream traffic best explains crashes and their types for the BFS, whereas, the ramp flow has the highest influence in determining the types of crashes within the ramp vicinities. The paper also discusses about the applicability of different countermeasures, such as, variable speed limits, temporary restriction on lane changing, posting warnings, etc., to attenuate different patterns of hazardous traffic conditions. The study outcome can be utilized in designing location and traffic condition specific proactive road safety management systems for urban expressways.},

keywords = {Text-mining, Near-miss narratives, Fire fighter injury, Bayesian models},
abstract = {Background
In occupational safety research, narrative text analysis has been combined with coded surveillance, data to improve identification and understanding of injuries and their circumstances. Injury data give, information about incidence and the direct cause of an injury, while near-miss data enable the, identification of various hazards within an organization or industry. Further, near-miss data provide an, opportunity for surveillance and risk reduction. The National Firefighter Near-Miss Reporting System, (NFFNMRS) is a voluntary reporting system that collects narrative text data on near-miss and injurious, events within the fire and emergency services industry. In recent research, autocoding techniques, using Bayesian models have been used to categorize/code injury narratives with up to 90\% accuracy, thereby reducing the amount of human effort required to manually code large datasets. Autocoding, techniques have not yet been applied to near-miss narrative data.
Methods
We manually assigned mechanism of injury codes to previously un-coded narratives from the, NFFNMRS and used this as a training set to develop two Bayesian autocoding models, Fuzzy and Naïve. We calculated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for both models. We also evaluated, the effect of training set size on prediction sensitivity and compared the models’ predictive ability as, related to injury outcome. We cross-validated a subset of the prediction set for accuracy of the model, predictions.
Results
Overall, the Fuzzy model performed better than Naïve, with a sensitivity of 0.74 compared to 0.678., Where Fuzzy and Naïve shared the same prediction, the cross-validation showed a sensitivity of 0.602., As the number of records in the training set increased, the models performed at a higher sensitivity, suggesting that both the Fuzzy and Naïve models were essentially “learning”. Injury records were, predicted with greater sensitivity than near-miss records.
Conclusion
We conclude that the application of Bayesian autocoding methods can successfully code both near misses, and injuries in longer-than-average narratives with non-specific prompts regarding injury. Such, coding allowed for the creation of two new quantitative data elements for injury outcome and injury, mechanism.},

The primary objective of this study is to develop real-time crash risk prediction models for different segment types and traffic flow states on expressways. The mainline of expressways is divided into basic segment and ramp vicinity, and the traffic flow states are classified into uncongested and congested conditions. Also, Korean expressways have irregular intervals between loop detector stations. Therefore, we investigated on the effect and application of the detector stations at irregular intervals for the crash risk prediction on expressways. The most significant traffic variables were selected by conditional logistic regression analysis which could control confounding factors. Based on the selected traffic variables, separate models to predict crash risk were developed using genetic programming technique. The model estimation results showed that the traffic flow characteristics leading to crashes are differed by segment type and traffic flow state. Especially, the variables related to the intervals between detector stations had a significant influence on crash risk prediction under the uncongested condition. Finally, compared with the single model for all crashes and the logistic models used in previous studies, the proposed models showed higher prediction performance. The results of this study can be applied to develop more effective proactive safety management strategies for different segment types and traffic flow states on expressways with loop detector stations at irregular intervals.},

Variation in strength of correlations between anger and aggressive reactions in the 21 UK DAS items showed that the relationship between driver anger and aggression depends in part on the characteristics of the situation. In addition, three path models for describing the relationships among the measures were constructed separately for women and men. The models suggested that the effects of verbal aggressiveness on self-reported driver aggression were mediated by driver anger whereas physical aggressiveness was directly related to aggressive behaviour. Age was negatively related to both driver anger and aggression among men whereas annual mileage was negatively related to aggression among women.

These data were drawn from a series of events during which study participants drove through a series of intersections where the traffic signals changed from the green to yellow phase. The resulting dataset provides potential insights into how driver behavior is affected by distracted driving through an experimental design that alternated handheld, headset, and hands-free cell phone use with “normal” baseline driving events. The results of the study show that male drivers ages 18–45 were more likely to stop. Participants were also more likely to stop as they became more familiar with the simulator environment. Cell phone use was found to some influence on driver behavior in this setting, though the effects varied significantly across individuals. The study also demonstrates two methodological approaches for dealing with unobserved heterogeneity across drivers. These include random parameters and latent class logit models, each of which analyze the data as a panel. The results show each method to provide significantly better fit than a pooled, fixed parameter model. Differences in terms of the context of these two approaches are discussed, providing important insights as to the differences between these modeling frameworks.},

This study proposes Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to address complex, large and multi-dimensional spatial data in crash prediction. Correlation-based Feature Selector (CFS) was applied to evaluate candidate factors possibly related to zonal crash frequency in handling high-dimension spatial data. To demonstrate the proposed approaches and to compare them with the Bayesian spatial model with conditional autoregressive prior (i.e., CAR), a dataset in Hillsborough county of Florida was employed. The results showed that SVM models accounting for spatial proximity outperform the non-spatial model in terms of model fitting and predictive performance, which indicates the reasonableness of considering cross-zonal spatial correlations. The best model predictive capability, relatively, is associated with the model considering proximity of the centroid distance by choosing the RBF kernel and setting the 10\% of the whole dataset as the testing data, which further exhibits SVM models’ capacity for addressing comparatively complex spatial data in regional crash prediction modeling. Moreover, SVM models exhibit the better goodness-of-fit compared with CAR models when utilizing the whole dataset as the samples. A sensitivity analysis of the centroid-distance-based spatial SVM models was conducted to capture the impacts of explanatory variables on the mean predicted probabilities for crash occurrence. While the results conform to the coefficient estimation in the CAR models, which supports the employment of the SVM model as an alternative in regional safety modeling.},

With regard to safety research, it is important to predict abnormal events. At the machine side, reliability studies proved their value, but to predict failures in the human factor has been shown to be very difficult. Therefore, problems in how to define the notion of human error (Section 2) and how to classify different types of error (Section 3) are discussed. Some researchers started to use systematical classifications of human error types based on a recent, hierarchical model of human task performance. The outline of the model is presented. Examples of error analysis studies from the field of transportation research (Section 4) provide some basic suggestions on how to reduce error rates. Some conclusions on error control are given in Section 5. The responsibility of managers and system designers in this respect is strongly emphasized.},

abstract = {Sensible management of traffic safety is predicated on having reasonable expectations about the effect of various safety countermeasures. It is the role of evaluative research to derive such intelligence from empirical data. In spite of decades of research and experience, the safety effect of many countermeasures remains unknown. This sorry state of affairs is largely due to the objective difficulty of conducting conclusive experiments. Recognition of this objective difficulty should lead to the realization that in transport safety, knowledge is accumulated gradually from small, noisy and diverse experiments. The statistical tools used to extract knowledge from data should reflect this aspect of reality. One must therefore question the usefulness of classical tests of significance as a device for scientific progress in this field. It is argued that the unquestioning and all-pervasive use of significance testing in evaluative research on transport safety amounts to a self-inflicted learning disability. In contrast, it is shown that classical Point Estimation. Likelihood-Support and Bayesian methods can all make good use of experimental evidence which comes in small doses. In particular, the likelihood function is an efficient device for the accumulation of objective information and a necessary ingredient for Bayesian decision analysis.},

This has been accompanied by a heavy toll of deaths, In 1977, road accidents were the cause of 10\% of all deaths and 62\% of male deaths in the age group 15–25. The rates-per hundred million veh km-of fatalities, injuries and accidents (1980) were 35.202 and 416 respectively. The pedestrian fatality and casualty rates (1977) were high (20,134/100,000 population) especially among the old males over 64 (89,384/100,000 population). In the age group 20–24, casualty rate of drivers was 1256/100,000 driver (1977). Accidents were severe as well. Between 1970–1980 accident severity index was increasing with time and almost doubled by the end of the period reaching 13. Road accidents in Libya do not only represent an important social problem but also an economic one. In 1978, accidents cost the country about \$160 million. The factors which affect accident rates and severity are divided into behavioural and structural ones and investigated. There is room for improving traffic safety in Libya. A comprehensive traffic safety program is urgently needed.},

The individual characteristics of age at enlistment, educational level, and mental ability all were found to relate significantly to injury when considered singly. When considered jointly, however, only education had a major effect on injury rate. In general, the results indicated that the same individual characteristics that predict poor military performance also predict risk of accidental injury. The occupational analysis identified a number of high-risk occupational specialties (occupations with injury rates above the Navy norm). With the exception of Hospital Corpsmen, all of these occupations were engineering, construction, or aviation specialties in which exposure to hazardous machinery or equipment was evident. Improved safety training and closer supervision should be considered for these personnel, particularly nonhigh school graduates. A modified life table technique was found to be appropriate for this type of longitudinal analysis where large and uneven withdrawals from the cohort occurred. Further analyses of large cohorts from high-risk occupations will be needed to understand the causal factors underlying observed differences in injury rate.},

abstract = {The report details a catastrophe theory model of the accident process with empirical validation. According to the cusp model, two distinct levels of risk can be observed for a distribution of group accident rates, one at 0.0 Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA)-reportable accidents per 100 person-years of exposure and one at 11.5. Changes within or between the two levels are determined by two control parameters: environmental hazard (asymmetry) and operator load (bifurcation). The sample consisted of 68 work groups from 8 Milwaukee-Chicago area sheet metal mills and foundries who completed the Occupational Hazards Survey (OHS). The OHS contributed six bifurcation variables (safety management, life stress, physical stress anxiety, beliefs about accident control, and experience) and two asymmetry variables (environmental hazards and danger). All organizations received an interpretive report of their survey responses with recommendations for accident control, and had held their reports for two to nine months at the time the follow-up accident rate data were collected. There were two additional bifurcation variables: months holding report and group size. Regression analysis determined that the cusp model (R2 = .42) was more than twice as accurate as the best loglinear or linear alternative. Accidents were successfully controlled by safety managers' attention to recommendations produced by the OHS analysis. Catastrophe theory provided some novel insights regarding the linkage between predictor variables and actual behavior. Research has shown that a substantial percentage of occupational accidents are the result of human error. In an effort to explain and predict such errors in a systematic manner, an accident process model based on the cusp catastrophe is developed and tested. The model offers several unique and useful properties: (1) It proposes that changes in accident rates for work groups are the result of a nonlinear dynamic process. (2) The distribution of accident rates is bimodal, with one model near zero and the other at some higher level. (3) Changes in accident rates are predicted from four sources: (i) ambient danger and hazard levels, (ii) variables that impact upon human performance capability, (iii) initial accident rates, and (iv) the mathematical function that interrelates those variables. (4) The mathematical model has inherent properties that allow for causal inference. Environmental and human performance factors can be operationalized as sets of more specific variables. In this application, The Occupational Hazards Survey was used to gather data from mill and foundry workers pertaining to hazards and dangers, adequacy of safety management, stress, anxiety, and beliefs about accident control. Workgroup size was included as an additional predictor variable in the human performance category. The experiment evaluated change in accident rates as a function of initial accident rates, survey variables, group size, and implementations of recommendations derived from the survey data. On the basis of the results, it was possible to conclude (1) qualitative variables and recommendations significantly impacted on accident rates, and that (2) the nonlinear model was a superior predictor of change compared to a linear model containing the same qualitative variables.},

Such a review is meant to identify and establish the significance of policy and socioeconomic variables affecting the level of road accidents. The aim is to identify those variables associated with effective policies and interventions to enable decision makers to improve the level of road safety. The variables that appear to affect the number of fatalities or injuries are: vehicle miles travelled (VMT), vehicle population, income (in its various forms), percentage of young drivers, intervention policies such as speed limits, periodic vehicle inspection, and minimum alcohol-drinking age. Viewed critically, the state-of-the-art models being used to explain and predict road accidents are still deficient. One possible approach to correcting this deficiency draws from consumer utility theory, using analytical models built on a newly constructed theoretical framework. Success in estimating such models may improve predictions of road accidents, thus demonstrating the comparative cost effectiveness of alternative intervention policies.},

The results indicate that the dangers (e.g. unguarded machine parts) were more prevalent in the factories with the higher annual accident frequency. In the plants with higher accident frequency the jobs and tasks of individual workers were more varied, less frequently repeated, less preplanned, more mobile, and required assimilation of more complex information than those in the factories with low accident frequency. When the prevalence of the dangers was normalized for these factors very few differences remained between the two groups of plants.},

Three studies were therefore carried out to investigate drivers' risk-taking behavior. The first study involved a computer simulation of a traffic intersection, requiring judgements of clearance in closing gaps. Both performance and risk assessment were measured. Strategies observed in the performance task were a function of age and sex, although no such differences were evident in the subjective risk estimates. The second study required assessment of risk in photographs of road situations taken from the driver's viewpoint. It was found that risk assessments could be manipulated by motivational instructions. The third study was similar to the second, except that a video tape-recorder was used for presenting the stimulus material. The results suggested that perceived risk falls with increasing age and experience in young male drivers. It was concluded that the assessment of perceived risk may be biased by task and motivational variables and therefore subjective reports of risk require validation by the use of performance measures.},

abstract = {Transportation systems in the industrialized world require vast amounts of economic and human resources. Most of the risks associated with these systems are due to the frequent use of private cars. This paper gives a review of the literature and psychological facts which may explain why the individual driver and modern society seem willing to accept higher risks in road transportation than in most other activities. Risky driving behavior may depend on (a) a driver's overestimation of his driving skill in a particular situation, (b) his conscious decision to drive under high risk or (c) his failure to perceive risk in a particular situation. It is pointed out that different means must be used in order to affect a change in these factors, mainly, training programs, the spread of information to change drivers' attitudes towards traffic risks, and environmental design changes to subjective risk. In general, empirical research indicates that greater risks are accepted if some kind of control is experienced in a situation and this is especially applicable to driving. Objective and subjective estimates of the riskiness of different elements inherent in road traffic seem to coincide fairly well with regard to a road's physical characteristics. But objective risks are underestimated in relation to speed, black spots, night driving, and narrow roads. The importance of these factors, and of alcohol intoxication and imitative behaviour for risk taking, is discussed. Comparisons of the estimated risks of different transportation systems and other risk sources are discussed. The attribution of the responsibility for an accident is very important for the risks accepted by a society. If the responsibility can be attributed to individual risk takers, as in car driving, society is willing to accept higher risk levels. Finally, the prevailing within-system perspective on risks in road transportation is contrasted with the more important and difficult global perspective which puts the risks of the road transportation system in a societal context.},

abstract = {United States traffic fatalities dropped dramatically from 49,301 in 1981 to an estimated 43,721 in 1982. Fatalities are at their lowest level in 20 yr, and fatalities per mile of travel are the lowest ever recorded. A decrease of similar magnitude occurred only in 1974, when the oil crisis, the national 55 mph speed limit, and depressed economic conditions disrupted the nation's driving habits. In 1982 the potential explanations are more difficult to observe and test. This paper examines several factors which may have contributed to the 1982 changes, including alcohol programs, occupant restraint use, demographic shifts, economic conditions, and travel patterns. Each factor's effect is assessed, though available data do not permit precise quantification. Implications of these findings for 1983 and beyond are discussed.},

In this paper data from official sources and spot studies of small populations in India have been used to extrapolate for the whole country to get an estimate of the magnitude of the problem. The results indicate that injuries in India may be as much of a health problem for individuals 5 yr old and above as in the high income countries.},

abstract = {This paper, presented in two parts, assesses the potentialities and limitations of the deviation concept as applied to occupational accident control. A systems variable is classified as a deviation when its value falls outside a norm. In Part I, a systems model of accidents that incorporates the deviation concept is presented. Theories, models, terms, and taxonomies of the occupational accident research literature are analyzed in relation to this model in order to identify general elements. Theoretical and methodological problems concerning the definition of norms and taxonomies of deviations are discussed. In Part II measures of the significance of deviations with respect to the risk of accidents and criteria for the assessment of methods for the collection of data on deviations are operationalized. Empirical research on relations between deviations and accidents and on methods for data collection are reviewed on the basis of these measures and criteria. It is concluded that the deviation concept provides a valid basis for the design of information systems for the efficient control of accidents in production systems in operation. Considerations for the design of information systems for the collection, storing, processing, and feedback of information on deviations for accident prevention purposes are discussed.},

A self-administered questionnaire including 80 variables was used to collect data from the workers. The study population consisted of 207 workers at nine work places. The survey response rate was 93\% (193 workers). The attitudes of coworkers, and judgments and attentiveness had a statistically highly significant effect on the worker's own attitude. The attitudes of supervisors, attitudes of coworkers, and the manner of instructing had a statistically highly significant effect on the performance feedback. The workers felt that the establishment of safe work habits would be most affected by the road supervisor's management methods and feedback. A considerable proportion of the workers believed that risk taking was part of their job.},

abstract = {Nigerian Coal Corporation started operations in 1916 and in October 1977 introduced full mechanization at its coal mine in Enugu. An appraisal of the mining accidents between 1975–1980 showed an overall downward trend following mechanization, from 1073 per 1000 in 1975 to 425 in 1980 (a 60\% reduction). The underground accidents were reduced from a monthly average of 63 to 26 but those at the surface remained basically unaffected. Changes were also recorded in sickness absences indices, with the most significant occurring with respect to the severity index which dropped from 9.2 in 1975 to 3.0 in 1980. The distribution of injury remained essentially the same except that injuries to the upper limbs became more common than the more serious pelvic injury prior to mechanization. The impact of mechanization in industries in developing countries are discussed and ways of ensuring optimum benefits from this transfer of technology suggested.},
