abstract = {Fitness apps, such as Strava, are a growing source of data for mapping bicycling ridership, due to large samples and high resolution. To overcome bias introduced by data generated from only fitness app users, researchers build statistical models that predict total bicycling by integrating Strava data with official counts and geographic data. However, studies conducted on single cities provide limited insight on best practices for modeling bicycling with Strava as generalizability is difficult to assess. Our goal is to develop a generalized approach to modeling bicycling ridership using Strava data. In doing so we enable detailed mapping that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and will support more equitable decision-making across cities. We used Strava data, official counts, and geographic data to model Average Annual Daily Bicycling (AADB) in five cities: Boulder, Ottawa, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Victoria. Using a machine learning approach, LASSO, we identify variables important for predicting ridership in all cities, and independently in each city. Using the LASSO-selected variables as predictors in Poisson regression, we built generalized and city-specific models and compared accuracy. Our results indicate generalized prediction of bicycling ridership on a road segment in concert with Strava data should include the following variables: number of Strava riders, percentage of Strava trips categorized as commuting, bicycling safety, and income. Inclusion of city-specific variables increased model performance, as the R2 for generalized and city-specific models ranged from 0.08–0.80 and 0.68–0.92, respectively. However, model accuracy was influenced most by the official count data used for model training. For best results, official count data should capture diverse street conditions, including low ridership areas. Counts collected continuously over a long time period, rather than at peak periods, may also improve modeling. Modeling bicycling from Strava and geographic data enables mapping of bicycling ridership that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and better able to support decision-making.}

abstract = {Multi-vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (MVRPSTW) is an indispensable constituent in urban logistics distribution systems. Over the past decade, numerous methods for MVRPSTW have been proposed, but most are based on heuristic rules that require a large amount of computation time. With the current rapid increase of logistics demands, traditional methods incur the dilemma between computational efficiency and solution quality. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called the Multi-Agent Attention Model that can solve routing problem instantly benefit from lengthy offline training. Specifically, the vehicle routing problem is regarded as a vehicle tour generation process, and an encoder-decoder framework with attention layers is proposed to generate tours of multiple vehicles iteratively. Furthermore, a multi-agent reinforcement learning method with an unsupervised auxiliary network is developed for the model training. By evaluated on four synthetic networks with different scales, the results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms Google OR-Tools and traditional methods with little computation time. In addition, we validate the robustness of the well-trained model by varying the number of customers and the capacities of vehicles.}

This paper aims to model the multi-driver repositioning task through a mean field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that captures competition among multiple agents. Because the direct application of MARL to the multi-driver system under a given reward mechanism will likely yield a suboptimal equilibrium due to the selfishness of drivers, this study proposes a reward design scheme with which a more desired equilibrium can be reached. To effectively solve the bilevel optimization problem with upper level as the reward design and the lower level as a multi-agent system, a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is adopted to speed up the learning process. We then apply the bilevel optimization model to two case studies, namely, e-hailing driver repositioning under service charge and multiclass taxi driver repositioning under NYC congestion pricing. In the first case study, the model is validated by the agreement between the derived optimal control from BO and that from an analytical solution. With a simple piecewise linear service charge, the objective of the e-hailing platform can be increased by 8.4%. In the second case study, an optimal toll charge of $5.1 is solved using BO, which improves the objective of city planners by 7.9%, compared to that without any toll charge. Under this optimal toll charge, the number of taxis in the NYC central business district is decreased, indicating a better traffic condition, without substantially increasing the crowdedness of the subway system.}

A sequence to sequence model embedded with the attention mechanism forms the backbone of this framework. The sequence to sequence model consists of an encoder network and a decoder network, making it good at modeling sequential data with varying lengths and the attention mechanism further enhances its ability to capture long-range dependencies. We use the proposed framework to predict the number of passengers alighting at each station in the near future, given the number of passengers boarding at each station in the last few short-term periods. The large quantities of real-world data collected from Singapore’s metro system are used to validate the proposed model. In addition, a set of comparisons made among our model and other classical approaches evidently indicates that the proposed model is more scalable and robust than other baselines in making multi-step and network-wide predictions for short-term passenger flow.}

abstract = {Activity-based modelling is a modern agent-based approach to travel demand modelling, in which the transport demand is derived from the agent’s needs to perform certain activities at specific places and times. The agent’s mobility is considered in a broader context, which allows the activity-based models to produce more realistic trip chains, compared to traditional trip-based models. The core of any activity-based model is an activity scheduler – a software component producing sequences of agent’s daily activities interconnected by trips, called activity schedules. Traditionally, activity schedulers used to rely heavily on hard-coded knowledge of transport behaviour experts. We introduce the concept of a Data-Driven Activity Scheduler (DDAS), which replaces numerous expert-designed components and their intricately engineered interactions with a collection of machine learning models. Its architecture is significantly simpler, making it easier to deploy and maintain. This shift towards data-driven, machine learning based approach is possible due to increased availability of mobility-related data. We demonstrate DDAS concept using our own proof-of-concept implementation, perform a rigorous analysis and compare the validity of the resulting model to one of the rule-based alternatives using the Validation Framework for Activity-Based Models (VALFRAM).}

abstract = {Real-time crash prediction is essential for proactive traffic safety management. However, developing an accurate prediction model is challenging as the traffic data of crash and non-crash cases are extremely imbalanced. Most of the previous studies undersampled non-crash cases to balance the data, which may not capture the heterogeneity of the full non-crash data. This study aims to use the emerging deep learning method called deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) model to fully understand the traffic data leading to crashes. With the full understanding of the traffic data of crashes, the DCGAN model could generate more synthetic data related to crashes to balance the dataset. All non-crash data could be used for developing the prediction models. To capture the correlations between different variables, the data are augmented to 2-D matrix as the input for the DCGAN model. The suggested model is evaluated based on data from expressways and compared to two counterparts: (1) synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE); (2) random undersampling technique. The results suggest that the DCGAN could better understand the crash data characteristics by generating data with better fit of the real data distribution. Four different crash prediction algorithms (i.e., logistic regression model, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and convolutional neural network) are developed based on each balanced data and totally twelve models were estimated. The results indicate that the convolutional neural network model based on the DCGAN balanced data could provide the best prediction accuracy, validating that the proposed oversampling method could be used for the data balance. Besides, compared to other two models, only the DCGAN-based model could identify the significant effects of speed difference between the upstream and downstream locations which could help guide traffic management strategies. With the prediction model developed based on the balanced data by DCGAN, it is expected that more crashes could be predicted and prevented with more appropriate proactive traffic safety management strategies such as Variable Speed Limits (VSL) and Dynamic Message Signs (DMS).}

Existing traffic flow prediction models mainly extract static spatial-temporal correlations, although these correlations are known to be dynamic in traffic networks. Attention-based models have emerged in recent years, mostly in the field of natural language processing, and have resulted in major progresses in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. This inspires us to introduce the application of attentions for traffic flow prediction. In this study, a deep learning based traffic flow predictor with spatial and temporal attentions (STANN) is proposed. The spatial and temporal attentions are used to exploit the spatial dependencies between road segments and temporal dependencies between time steps respectively. Experiment results with a real-world traffic dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model. The results also show that the utilization of multiple data resolutions could help improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed model is demonstrated to have potential for improving the understanding of spatial-temporal correlations in a traffic network.}

Many studies have been made to improve AVs’ ability of environment recognition and vehicle control, while the attention paid to decision making is not enough and the existing decision algorithms are very preliminary. Therefore, a framework of the decision-making training and learning is put forward in this paper. It consists of two parts: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training program and the high-fidelity virtual simulation environment. Then the basic microscopic behavior, car-following (CF), is trained within this framework. In addition, theoretical analysis and experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed reward functions for accelerating training using DRL. The results show that on the premise of driving comfort, the efficiency of the trained AV increases 7.9% and 3.8% respectively compared to the classical adaptive cruise control models, intelligent driver model and constant-time headway policy. Moreover, on a more complex three-lane section, we trained an integrated model combining both CF and lane-changing behavior, with the average speed further growing 2.4%. It indicates that our framework is effective for AV’s decision-making learning.}

The integration of autonomous vehicles, such as drones, in the last-mile network design can curtail many operational challenges and provide a competitive advantage. This paper deals with the problem of delivering orders to a set of customer locations using multiple drones that operate in conjunction with a single truck. To take advantage of the drone fleet, the delivery tasks are parallelized by concurrently dispatching the drones from a truck parked at a focal point (ideal drone launch location) to the nearby customer locations. Hence, the key decisions to be optimized are the partitioning of delivery locations into small clusters, identifying a focal point per cluster, and routing the truck through all focal points such that the customer orders in each cluster are fulfilled either by a drone or truck. In contrast to prior studies that tackle this problem using multi-phase sequential procedures, this paper presents mathematical programming models to jointly optimize all the decisions involved. We also consider two polices for choosing a cluster focal point - (i) restricting it to one of the customer locations, and (ii) allowing it to be anywhere in the delivery area (i.e., a customer or non-customer location). Since the models considering unrestricted focal points are computationally expensive, an unsupervised machine learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution time. Initially, we treat the problem as a single objective by independently minimizing either the total cost or delivery completion time. Subsequently, the two conflicting objectives are considered together for obtaining the set of best trade-off solutions. An extensive computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of restricting the focal points, and the influence of adopting a joint optimization method instead of a sequential approach. Finally, several key insights are obtained to aid the logistics practitioners in decision making.}

A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is designed to learn the continuous longitudinal acceleration/deceleration to reduce the fuel consumption as well as to maintain acceptable travel time. Collecting the critic’s value of each single lane from DDPG and integrating the information of adjacent lanes, a deep Q-learning algorithm is developed to make the discrete lane-changing decision. Together, a hybrid deep Q-learning and policy gradient (HDQPG) method is developed for vehicles driving along multi-lane urban signalized corridors. The method can enable the controlled vehicle to learn well-established longitudinal fuel-saving strategies, and to perform appropriate lane-changing operations at proper times to avoid congested lanes. Numerical experiments show that HDQPG can reduce fuel consumption by up to 46% with marginal or no increase of travel times.}

There has been a pronounced progress in the use of machine learning models for crash events assessment by the transportation safety research community in recent years. However, little attention has been paid so far to evaluating real-time crash occurrences within information fusion systems. The main aim of this paper is to design and validate an ensemble fusion framework founded on the use of various base classifiers that operate on fused features and a Meta classifier that learns from base classifiers’ results to acquire more performant crash predictions. A data-driven approach was adopted to investigate the potential of fusing four real-time and continuous categories of features namely physiological signals, driver maneuvering inputs, vehicle kinematics and weather covariates in order to systematically identify the crash strongest precursors through feature selection techniques. Moreover, a resampling-based scheme, including Bagging and Boosting, is conducted to generate diversity in learner combinations comprising Bayesian Learners (BL), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). To ensure that the proposed framework provide powerful and stable decisions, an imbalance-learning strategy was adopted using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance problem as crash events usually occur in rare instances. The findings show that Boosting depicted the highest performance within the fusion scheme and can accomplish a maximum of 93.66% F1 score and 94.81% G-mean with Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Networks, k-NN and SVM with MLP as the Meta-classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first attempt at establishing a fusing framework on the basis of data from the four aforementioned categories and fusion models while accounting for class imbalance. Overall, the method and findings provide new insights into crash prediction and can be harnessed as a promising tool to improve intervention efforts related to traffic intelligent transportation systems.}

This research studies two particular problems in traffic forecasting: (1) capture the dynamic and non-local spatial correlation between traffic links and (2) model the dynamics of temporal dependency for accurate multiple steps ahead predictions. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning framework named Spatial-Temporal Sequence to Sequence model (STSeq2Seq). This model builds on sequence to sequence (seq2seq) architecture to capture temporal feature and relies on graph convolution for aggregating spatial information. Moreover, STSeq2Seq defines and constructs Pattern-aware Adjacency Matrix (PAM) based on pair-wise similarity of the recent traffic patterns on traffic links and integrates it into graph convolution operation. It also deploys a novel seq2sesq architecture which couples a convolutional encoder and a recurrent decoder with attention mechanism for dynamic modeling of long-range dependence between different time steps. We conduct extensive experiments using two publicly-available large-scale traffic datasets and compare STSeq2Seq with other baseline models. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in terms of various error measures. The ablation study verifies the effectiveness of PAMs in capturing dynamic non-local spatial correlation and the superiority of proposed seq2seq architecture in modeling non-stationary temporal dependency for multiple steps ahead prediction. Furthermore, qualitative analysis is conducted on PAMs as well as the attention weights for model interpretation.}

abstract = {We develop a personalized system to modify individual travel behaviors by offering personalized incentives. Individual preferences are learned to provide personalized incentives so that the promoted alternative is likely accepted. Using knowledge from control theories and state estimation, we model travelers’ choice-making behaviors with the random utility theory and responses from the individuals are mined by a particle filter for learning individual preferences to promote sustainable behaviors. The discrete nature of travel behavior naturally leads to limited observability. We overcome this problem by designing a measurement function from which additional information can be solicited. Additionally, the inherent trade-offs between factors that affect travel choices result in an infinite set of solutions. We thus propose two solutions: (1) the divide and conquer strategy in which a multi-dimensional conditional probability function is proposed; and (2) use of domain knowledge to restrict that preference values fall in certain ranges and are consistent with certain distributions. The performance of preference learning with these two solutions applied is shown via simulation tests and an online experiment involving human participants. For departure time choices, we show an average acceptance ratio of 0.68 for all participants when being promoted with alternatives with personalized incentives. We also show that changes in individual departure time choices will lead to 48% reduction in total travel time on a simple transportation network.}

abstract = {The airspace system is a complex dynamical system with complicated controlled interactions between its constituent subsystems – terminal airspace, en-route airspace, and ground. Of these, air traffic management in the multi-airport (metroplex) terminal airspace is one of the most complicated subsystems to manage, especially due to the interactions between proximal airports. Analyzing anomalous behaviors in the metroplex is emerging as a key problem in understanding air traffic management complexity and safety. Although physics-based approaches have been studied in-depth for this application, newfound interest has been observed to use recorded time-series air traffic surveillance and airport operations datasets for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithm that generates mathematical models to detect anomalies in metroplex operations. Several machine learning algorithms have been developed to detect anomalies using only air traffic surveillance data, but there is a significant scope of improvement by including airport operational characteristics as well, since integrating such closely-controlled metroplex operational datasets allows the developed models to effectively detect anomalies. The key contribution of this paper is in allowing anomaly detection models to recursively update so as to adapt to changes in metroplex operations. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated with real air traffic surveillance and airport operations datasets at LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy, and Newark airports, thereby detecting anomalies for operations in the New York metroplex.}

Logarithmic multivariate Gaussian models are trained to evaluate the performance of aircrafts at different flight phases (takeoff, ascent, cruise, etc.) separately. By including a forward synchronization, feature selection, and mini-batch training process, this model overcomes challenges introduced by the large size and high dimensionality of flight datasets. This framework also addresses the re-sampling issue in existing literature causing difficulties in handling time-series signals with different lengths. For demonstration and validation, the developed model is applied to analyze performance anomalies associated with the mechanical system and pilot operation in a historical flight dataset. Compared with existing literature focusing on similar datasets, this evaluation methodology shows promise in detecting performance anomalies especially at approach and takeoff phases. Therefore, the developed model is expected to be an effective addition to the current anomaly analysis and monitoring technologies for scheduled commercial flights. Applications include assisting transportation management systems by handling large amounts of historical flight datasets to analyze mechanical and operational anomalies, which may potentially improve future aeronautical system design and pilot training.}

To capture the complex non-stationary temporal dynamics and spatial correlations in multistep traffic-condition prediction, we propose a novel deep learning framework named attention graph convolutional sequence-to-sequence model (AGC-Seq2Seq). In the proposed deep learning framework, spatial and temporal dependencies are modeled through the Seq2Seq model and graph convolution network separately, and the attention mechanism along with a newly designed training method based on the Seq2Seq architecture is proposed to overcome the difficulty in multistep prediction and further capture the temporal heterogeneity of traffic pattern. We conduct numerical tests to compare AGC-Seq2Seq with other benchmark models using two real-world datasets. The results indicate that our model yields the best prediction performance in terms of various prediction error measures. Furthermore, the variations of spatio-temporal correlations of traffic conditions under different perdition steps and road segments are revealed.}

This study investigates pedestrian crossing behaviour which, as an important element of urban dynamics, is expected to be affected by the presence of automated vehicles. For this purpose, an interpretable machine learning framework is proposed to explore factors affecting pedestrians’ wait time before crossing mid-block crosswalks in the presence of automated vehicles. To collect rich behavioural data, we developed a dynamic and immersive virtual reality experiment, with 180 participants from a heterogeneous population in 4 different locations in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Pedestrian wait time behaviour is then analysed using a data-driven Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model, in which the linear combination of the covariates is replaced by a flexible non-linear deep neural network. The proposed model achieved a 5% improvement in goodness of fit, but more importantly, enabled us to incorporate a richer set of covariates. A game theoretic based interpretability method is used to understand the contribution of different covariates to the time pedestrians wait before crossing. Results show that the presence of automated vehicles on roads, wider lane widths, high density on roads, limited sight distance, and lack of walking habits are the main contributing factors to longer wait times. Our study suggested that, to move towards pedestrian-friendly urban areas, educational programs for children, enhanced safety measures for seniors, promotion of active modes of transportation, and revised traffic rules and regulations should be considered.}

As an innovation compared with the posterior LC risk prediction methods proposed in previous studies, this study develops a pre-emptive LC risk level prediction (P-LRLP) method, which is able to estimate the crash risk level of an LC event in advance before the LC car completes the LC maneuver. The basic concept of this method is to apply a machine learning classifier to predict the LC risk level based on cars’ key space-series features at the beginning of the LC event. To boost the prediction performance, an innovative resampling method, namely ENN-SMOTE-Tomek Link (EST), and an advanced machine learning classifier, namely LightGBM, are proposed and employed in the development of the P-LRLP method. Meanwhile, an algorithm which can measure the stability of the selected key features in terms of the randomness and size of training samples is developed to evaluate the feature selection methods. A digitalized vehicles’ trajectory dataset, the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) is used for method validation. The validation results manifest that the EST can achieve satisfactory resampling performance while Random Forest (RF), as an embedded FS method, achieves remarkable performance on both stability of selected features and prediction of risk level. The results also show that the LC risk level can be most accurately predicted when the LC car moves to the position where the distance between the longitudinal center line of the LC car and the marking line separating the two lanes equals 1.5ft. As an innovative LC risk level prediction technique, the P-LRLP method could be integrated with advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to remedy potential risky LC maneuver in the future.}

abstract = {Recently, an abundant amount of urban vehicle trajectory data has been collected in road networks. Many studies have used machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in vehicle trajectories to predict location sequences of individual travelers. Unlike the previous studies that used a discriminative modeling approach, this research suggests a generative modeling approach to learn the underlying distributions of urban vehicle trajectory data. A generative model for urban vehicle trajectories can better generalize from training data by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and, thus, produce synthetic vehicle trajectories similar to real vehicle trajectories with limited observations. Synthetic trajectories can provide solutions to data sparsity or data privacy issues in using location data. This research proposes TrajGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for the urban vehicle trajectory generation. In TrajGAIL, learning location sequences in observed trajectories is formulated as an imitation learning problem in a partially observable Markov decision process. The model is trained by the generative adversarial framework, which uses the reward function from the adversarial discriminator. The model is tested with both simulation and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model obtained significant performance gains compared to existing models in sequence modeling.}

The dependence on the infrastructure and the increasing demand from these users press public transportation agencies for cost-effective sidewalk maintenance and better Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance. Unfortunately, most of the agencies still rely on outdated sidewalk mapping data or manual survey results for their sidewalk management. In this study, a network-level sidewalk inventory method is proposed by efficiently segmenting the mobile light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data using a customized deep neural network, i.e., PointNet++, and followed by integrating a stripe-based sidewalk extraction algorithm. By extracting the sidewalk locations from the mobile LiDAR point cloud, the corresponding geometry features, e.g., width, grade, cross slope, etc., can be extracted for the ADA compliance and the overall condition assessment. The experimental test conducted on the entire State Route 9, Massachusetts has shown promising performance in terms of the accuracy for the sidewalk extraction (i.e., point-level intersect over union (IoU) value of 0.946) and the efficiency for network analysis of the ADA compliance (i.e., approximately 6.5 min/mile). A case study conducted in Columbus District in Boston, Massachusetts, demonstrates that the proposed method can not only successfully support transportation agencies with an accurate and efficient means for network-level sidewalk inventory, but also support wheelchair users with accurate and comprehensive sidewalk inventory information for better navigation and route planning.}

abstract = {This study examines the potential of using smart card data in public transit systems to infer attributes of travelers, thereby facilitating a more user-centered public transport service design while reducing the use of expensive and time-consuming travel surveys. This is challenging since travel behaviors vary significantly over the population, space, and time and developing meaningful links between them and traveler attributes are not trivial. To achieve this, we conduct an extensive analysis of spatio-temporal travel behavior patterns using smart card data from the Greater Sydney area (Opal card), and then develop a Hybrid Neural Network to utilize spatial and temporal dependencies in the dataset. In particular, we first empirically analyze passengers’ movements and mobility patterns from both spatial and temporal perspectives and design a set of discriminative features to characterize the patterns. We then propose a deep-learning-based framework to investigate spatial and temporal features in order to infer traveler attributes. The proposed modeling framework consists of two components, i.e., a Product-based Spatial–Temporal Module (PSTM) and an Auto-Encoder-based Compression Module (AECM). PSTM encodes the relationships across a variety of features while AECM derives useful spatial information from a transit stop matrix. The proposed model is tested and evaluated using a large-scale public transport dataset in the Greater Sydney area to infer two attributes of passengers, i.e., the age group and residential area. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against a number of established tools in the literature. The developed techniques can be potentially adapted to other domains where spatio-temporal features are critical, such as commercial/entertainment site selection and urban service planning.}

abstract = {The development of trajectory-based operations and the rolling network operations plan in European air traffic management network implies a move towards more collaborative, strategic flight planning. This opens up the possibility for inclusion of additional information in the collaborative decision-making process. With that in mind, we define the indicator for the economic risk of network elements (e.g., sectors or airports) as the expected costs that the elements impose on airspace users due to Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations. The definition of the indicator is based on the analysis of historical ATFM regulations data, that provides an indication of the risk of accruing delay. This risk of delay is translated into a monetary risk for the airspace users, creating the new metric of the economic risk of a given airspace element. We then use some machine learning techniques to find the parameters leading to this economic risk. The metric is accompanied by an indication of the accuracy of the delay–cost prediction model. Lastly, the economic risk is transformed into a qualitative economic severity classification. The economic risks and consequently economic severity can be estimated for different temporal horizons and time periods providing an indicator which can be used by Air Navigation Service Providers to identify areas which might need the implementation of strategic measures (e.g., resectorisation or capacity provision change), and by Airspace Users to consider operation of routes which use specific airspace regions.}

AARs are dependent on selected runway configurations and both are affected by weather conditions.

This study presents a data-driven deep-learning framework for predicting both runway configurations and AARs to support efficient air traffic management for complex multi-airport systems. The two major contributions from this work are 1) the proposed model uses assembled gridded weather forecast for the terminal airspace instead of an isolated station-based terminal weather forecast, and 2) the model captures the operational interdependency aspects inherent in the parameter learning process so that proposed modeling framework can predict both runway configuration and AARs simultaneously with higher accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated with a numerical experiment taking three major airports in New York Metroplex as the case study. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method is compared with methods in current literature and the analysis results show that the proposed method outperforms all existing methods.}

The framework depicts a powerful combination of a data-driven control method that is used to imitate the control behaviour of dispatchers and a mathematical optimization method. Three components comprise the DDHC framework: a data-driven control module, a performance module, and an optimization module. The data-driven control module contains a random forest model which is adopted to justify whether to intervene in the operation of a bus line, and if so, which vehicles should be controlled and what type of control strategy should be taken – an acceleration strategy or deceleration strategy. The performance module including vehicle operation state models is used to describe the system evolution. The last component optimizes the specific control actions – which type of acceleration or deceleration strategy should be adopted – by minimizing total passenger travel time. The effectiveness of the proposed DDHC framework is evaluated with the data of a transit route in Urumqi, China. The results show that the DDHC framework with reasonable parameters can suit the needs of real-time control in complex traffic environments.}

Given a public event produces complicated spatiotemporal traffic impacts, existing data-driven approaches without involving traffic flow analysis show limited effectiveness to predict a public event. Motivated by this view, this study seeks to develop a domain-knowledge-based learning approach, which integrates shock wave analysis into deep learning models to predict the occurring of an upcoming public event (i.e., the SW-DLM approach). This integration raises new research challenging and calls for new approaches. Specifically, we develop an efficient algorithm to generate the shock wave diagrams to present the evolvement of the traffic anomaly, which expands whenever new traffic data is collected. Next, the shock wave diagram itself is not a well-coded input for feature extraction and learning. This study thus developed an innovative encoding approach, which transforms a shock wave diagram into an optimal pixel grid. Considering the features extracted from the encoded shock wave diagrams are fed into the long-short term memory (LSTM) model for the event prediction. The numerical experiments based on the field data indicate that the SW-DLM is able to predict a public event with 87% accuracy around 84 min before it starts in a day. It outperforms all data-driven machine learning models using point traffic data as inputs. Thus, we claim that using the shock wave diagrams can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the learning approaches for predicting a public event. The SW-DLM will help develop preventive traffic control or route plans to avoid traffic congestion induced by public events.}

A variety of methods to predict traffic variables in the short-term can be found in the literature, ranging from time-series algorithms, machine learning tools and deep learning methods to a selective hybrid of these approaches. Despite the advances in prediction techniques, a challenging problem that affects the application of such methods in the real world is the prevalence of insufficient data across an entire network. It is rare that extensive historical training data required for model training are available for all the links in a city. In order to address this data insufficiency problem, this paper applies transfer learning techniques to machine learning methods in short-term traffic prediction. All the traffic data used in this paper were collected from Highways England road networks in the UK. The results show that through improving the transferability of machine learning-based models, the computational burden due to the model training process can be significantly reduced and the prediction accuracy under data deficient scenarios can be improved for one-step ahead prediction. However, the prediction accuracy gradually decreases in multi-step ahead prediction. It is also found that the accuracy of the proposed hybrid method is highly dependent upon consistency between datasets but less dependent on geographical attributes of links.}

The scarce long-term estimation strategies currently found in the literature are commonly based on the detection and assignment to patterns, but their performance decays when unexpected events provoke non predictable changes, or if the allocation to a traffic pattern is inaccurate. This work introduces a method to obtain long-term pattern forecasts and adapt them to real-time circumstances. To this end, a long-term estimation scheme based on the automated discovery of patterns is proposed and integrated with an on-line change detection and adaptation mechanism. The framework takes advantage of the architecture of evolving Spiking Neural Networks (eSNN) to perform adaptations without retraining the model, allowing the whole system to work autonomously in an on-line fashion. Its performance is assessed over a real scenario with 5 min data of a 6-month span of traffic in the center of Madrid, Spain. Significant accuracy gains are obtained when applying the proposed on-line adaptation mechanism on days with special, non-predictable events that degrade the quality of their long-term traffic forecasts.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile-internet technologies, on-demand ride-sourcing services have become increasingly popular and largely reshaped the way people travel. Demand prediction is one of the most fundamental components in supply-demand management systems of ride-sourcing platforms. With an accurate short-term prediction for origin-destination (OD) demand, the platforms make precise and timely decisions on real-time matching, idle vehicle reallocations, and ride-sharing vehicle routing, etc. Compared to the zone-based demand prediction that has been examined in many previous studies, OD-based demand prediction is more challenging. This is mainly due to the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among the demand of different OD pairs. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder Residual Multi-Graph Convolutional network (ST-ED-RMGC), a novel deep learning model for predicting ride-sourcing demand of various OD pairs. Firstly, the model constructs OD graphs, which utilize adjacent matrices to characterize the non-Euclidean pair-wise geographical and semantic correlations among different OD pairs. Secondly, based on the constructed graphs, a residual multi-graph convolutional (RMGC) network is designed to encode the contextual-aware spatial dependencies, and a long-short term memory (LSTM) network is used to encode the temporal dependencies, into a dense vector space. Finally, we reuse the RMGC networks to decode the compressed vector back to OD graphs and predict the future OD demand. Through extensive experiments on the for-hire-vehicles datasets in Manhattan, New York City, we show that our proposed deep learning framework outperforms the state-of-arts by a significant margin.}

abstract = {In the era of transportation big data, the analysis of mobility patterns generally involves large quantities of datasets with high-dimensional variables recording individual travelers’ activities and socio-economic attributes, bringing new challenges to researchers. Conventional regression-based models commonly require complex structures in depicting random or fixed effects with a considerable number of parameters to estimate, and state-of-the-art machine learning models are regarded as black-boxes that are not clear in interpreting the mechanism in human mobility. To overcome the challenges of capturing complex high-order relationships among variables of interest, this paper proposes a Bayesian supervised learning tensor factorization (BSTF) model for the classification of travel choices in the mobility pattern analysis. The BSTF model induces a hierarchical probabilistic structure between predictor variables and the dependent variable, which offers a nature supervised learning foundation via Bayesian inference. Latent class (LC) variables are considered in the BSTF model to discover hidden preferences/states among travelers associated with their mobility patterns. We apply the BSTF model to analyze passenger-side choice patterns between diverse service options on a ride-sourcing platform, drawing increasing attention during recent years. A case study with a real-world dynamic ridesharing dataset in Hangzhou, China, is conducted. Different cases of training sizes are utilized to fit the proposed BSTF model as well as some other state-of-the-art machine learning models. By identifying significant variables and derive their probabilistic relationship between service types (i.e., ridesharing, non-sharing, and taxi), the proposed BSTF model offers good performance in both classification accuracy and the interpretability of shared mobility.}

It lays the foundation for a number of advanced functions such as driver safety monitoring systems and adaptive driving assistance systems. In these applications, state recognition accuracy is of paramount importance to guarantee user acceptance. This paper is mainly focused on developing a personalized driving state recognition system by learning from non-intrusive, easily accessible vehicle related measurements and its validation using real-world driving data. Compared to conventional approaches, this paper first highlights the necessities of adopting a personalized system by analysing feature distribution of individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data via advanced data visualization and statistical analysis. If significant differences are identified, a dedicated personalized model is learnt to predict the driver’s driving state. Spearman distance is also drawn to evaluate the differences between individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data in a quantitative manner. In addition, five categories of classifiers are tested and compared to identify a suitable one for classification, where random forest with Bayesian parameter optimization outperforms others and therefore is adopted in this paper. A recently collected dataset from real-world driving experiments is adopted to evaluate the proposed system. Comparative experimental results indicate that the personalized learning system with road information significantly outperforms conventional approaches without considering personalized characteristics or road information, where the overall accuracy increases from 81.3% to 91.6%. It is believed that the newly developed personalized learning system can find a wide range of applications where diverse behaviours exist.}

Recently, deep learning based methods have been widely used in vehicle detection with high accuracy and efficiency. However, deep learning based methods require a large number of manually labeled ground truths (bounding box of each vehicle in each image) to train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the modern urban surveillance cameras, there are already many manually labeled ground truths in daytime images for training CNN, while there are little or much less manually labeled ground truths in nighttime images. In this paper, we focus on the research to make maximum usage of labeled daytime images (Source Domain) to help the vehicle detection in unlabeled nighttime images (Target Domain). For this purpose, we propose a new situation-sensitive method based on Faster R-CNN with Domain Adaptation (DA) to improve the vehicle detection at nighttime. Furthermore, a situation-sensitive traffic flow parameter estimation method is developed based on the traffic flow theory. We collected a new dataset of 2,200 traffic images (1,200 for daytime and 1,000 for nighttime) of 57,059 vehicles to evaluate the proposed method for the vehicle detection. Another new dataset with three 1,800-frame daytime videos and one 1,800-frame nighttime video of about 260 K vehicles was collected to evaluate and show the estimated traffic flow parameters in different situations. The experimental results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Medium-term demand forecasting is a significant insight to optimise resource allocation (staff and vehicles) and reduce operations costs. Using operational data from the reservation platform of the paratransit services in Toulouse, France, and enriching them with exogenous information, the study derives statistical and deep learning models for medium-term forecast. These models include a seasonal ARIMAX model with rolling forecast, a Random Forest Regressor, a LSTM neural network with exogenous information and a CNN neural network with independent variables. The seasonal ARIMAX model yields the best performance, suggesting that when linear relationships are considered, econometric models and deep learning models do not have significant differences in their performance. All the models show limited ability to grasp unique events with multi-day impacts such as strikes. Albeit a highly volatile demand and limited knowledge ahead of the forecast, these models suggest the volume of early reservations is a good proxy for the daily demand.}

The infrastructure managers have to come up with smart maintenance decisions in order to improve the assets’ condition, spend optimal cost and keep the network available. Currently, the infrastructure managers lack the tools and decision support models that could assist them in taking (un) planned maintenance decisions effectively and efficiently. Recently, many literature studies have proposed to employ the machine learning techniques to estimate the performance state of an asset, predict the maintenance need, possible failure modes, and such similar aspects in advance. Most of these studies have utilised additional data collection measures to record the assets’ behaviour. Though useful for experimentation, it is expensive and impractical to mount monitoring devices on multiple assets across the network. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop predictive models that utilise existing data from a railway agency and yield interpretable results. We propose to leverage the tree-based classification techniques of machine learning in order to predict maintenance need, activity type and trigger’s status of railway switches. Using the data from an in-use business process, predictive models based on the decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees are developed. Moreover, to facilitate in models interpretability, we provided a detail explanation of models’ predictions by features importance analysis and instance level details. Our solution approach of predictive models development and their results explanation have wider applicability and can be used for other asset types and different (maintenance) planning scenarios.}

These modules are combined via residual connections to capture the spatial, temporal and extraneous dependencies of travel demand. The end-to-end trainable RSTN redefines the traditional prediction problem as a learning residual function with regard to the travel density in each time interval. Further more, a dynamic request vector (DRV)-based data representation scheme is presented, which catches the intrinsic characteristics and variation of the trend, to improve the performance of forecasting. Simulations with two real-word data sets show that the proposed method outperforms the existing forecasting algorithms, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by up to 17.87%.}

In this paper, we adopt a deep learning model, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, to model the two basic behaviors simultaneously. By only observing the position information of the six vehicles surrounding the subject vehicle, the LSTM can extract the significant features that influence the CF and LC behaviors automatically and predict the vehicles behaviors with time-series data and memory effects. In addition, we propose a hybrid retraining constrained (HRC) training method to further optimize the LSTM model. With the I-80 trajectory data of NGSIM dataset we train and test the HRC LSTM model, while the results show that HRC LSTM model can accurately estimate CF and LC behaviors simultaneously with low longitudinal trajectories error and high LC prediction accuracy compared with the classical models. We also evaluate the transferability of the proposed model with the US101 dataset and a good transferability result is obtained as well.}

While a range of methods has been used in the past for driving style classification, the emergence of connected vehicles equipped with communication devices provides a new opportunity to classify driving style using high-resolution (10 Hz) microscopic real-world data. In this study, location-based big data and machine learning are used to classify driving styles ranging from aggressive to calm. This classification can be used to customize driver assistance systems, assess mobility, crash risk, fuel consumption, and emissions. This study’s main objective is to develop a framework that harnesses Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) generated by connected vehicles to quantify instantaneous driving behavior and classify driving styles in different spatial contexts using unsupervised machine learning methods. To this end, a subset of the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) with more than 27 million BSM observations generated by more than 1300 individuals making trips on diverse roadways and through several neighborhoods in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were processed and analyzed. To quantify driving style, the concept of temporal driving volatility, as a surrogate safety measure of unsafe driving behavior, was utilized and applied to vehicle kinematics, i.e., observed speeds and longitudinal/lateral accelerations. Specifically, six volatility measures are extracted and used for classifying drivers. K-means and K-medoids methods are applied for grouping drivers in aggressive, normal, and calm clusters. Clustering results indicate that not only does driving style vary among drivers, but the thresholds for aggressive and calm driving vary across different roadway types due to variations in environment and road conditions. The proportion of aggressive driving styles was also higher on commercial streets than on highways and residential streets. Notably, we propose a Driving Score to measure driving performance consistently across drivers.}

However, when users interact with the apps, the real potential and also the real challenge for modeling user behavior is that the apps not merely are data collection tools, but also change users’ behaviors.

With the rise of artificial intelligence, many recent studies attempted to use deep neural networks to extract comprehensive features from traffic networks to enhance prediction performance, given the volume and variety of traffic data has been greatly increased. Considering that traffic status on a road segment is highly influenced by the upstream/downstream segments and nearby bottlenecks in the traffic network, extracting well-localized features from these neighboring segments is essential for a traffic prediction model. Although the convolution neural network or graph convolution neural network has been adopted to learn localized features from the complex geometric or topological structure of traffic networks, the lack of flexibility in the local-feature extraction process is still a big issue. Classical wavelet transform can detect sudden changes and peaks in temporal signals. Analogously, when extending to the graph/spectral domain, graph wavelet can concentrate more on key vertices in the graph and discriminatively extract localized features. In this study, to capture the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in network-wide traffic data, we learn the traffic network as a graph and propose a graph wavelet gated recurrent (GWGR) neural network. The graph wavelet is incorporated as a key component for extracting spatial features in the proposed model. A gated recurrent structure is employed to learn temporal dependencies in the sequence data. Comparing to baseline models, the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance and training efficiency on two real-world datasets. In addition, experiments show that the sparsity of graph wavelet weight matrices greatly increases the interpretability of GWGR.}

With the development of intelligent navigation and autonomous driving, it is necessary to explore the lane-level predictions of traffic speeds. However, most existing traffic prediction models concentrate on forecasting the traffic flow characteristics of the entire road sections rather than those of certain lanes. This paper proposes a fusion deep learning (FDL) model to predict lane-level traffic speed. First, the entropy-based grey relation analysis is introduced to choose lane sections that are strongly correlated with the lane section to be predicted. Second, a two-layer deep learning framework is established by combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network. Third, the ground-truth data of several lane sections captured by remote traffic microwave sensors (RTMS) on the 2nd Ring Road of Beijing are utilized to examine the FDL model and compare it with several benchmark models. The experimental result indicates that in addition to capturing the fluctuations of traffic speed at the lane level, the FDL model has better performance than the benchmark models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability.}

abstract = {Rapid measurements of large-scale pavement roughness have long been a hot topic in pavement condition evaluation and maintenance. Most traditional methods rely on dedicated devices, such as laser, Lidar and so on, which should be set up on customized vehicles. With the rapid development of sensing technology, vehicles owned by the general public are empowered with the ability to collect vibration measurements themselves. This crowdsourced dataset is convenient, extensive coverage, inexpensive, and has high sampling frequency, making it a suitable source for large-scale pavement roughness evaluation. However, vehicle information is missing for these data due to privacy protection, which renders them quite difficult to directly use with traditional model-based methods. Thus, in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) model to deal with the problem of incomplete data and multi-vehicle data fusion. A mathematical derivation of the ‘international roughness index’ (IRI) using in-car vibrations is established. Furthermore, given the multi-vehicle scenario, a self-training model is designed to iteratively estimate IRIs in a roadway network. Both the confidences of the vehicle parameters and IRI estimation are considered in the algorithm to improve its reliability and robustness. A full-car simulation model is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the overall relative error is less than 10% for 50 road sections in the network, which is a significant improvement compared to traditional multi-vehicle average models. The errors of the SSL model are found to be significantly dependent on the iteration order. Based on the proposed model, the coupled impact of the sampling rate and vehicle quantity on the model’s accuracy is further discussed.

abstract = {As app-based ride-hailing services have been widely adopted within existing traditional taxi markets, researchers have been devoted to understand the important factors that influence the demand of the new mobility. Econometric models (EMs) are mainly utilized to interpret the significant factors of the demand, and deep neural networks (DNNs) have been recently used to improve the forecasting performance by capturing complex patterns in the large datasets. However, to mitigate possible (induced) traffic congestion and balance utilization rates for the current taxi drivers, an effective strategy of proactively managing a quota system for both emerging services and regular taxis is still critically needed. This paper aims to systematically design an explainable deep learning model capable of assessing the quota system balancing the demand volumes between two modes. A two-stage interpretable machine learning modeling framework was developed by a linear regression (LR) model, coupled with a neural network layered by long short-term memory (LSTM). The first stage investigates the correlation between the existing taxis and on-demand ride-hailing services while controlling for other explanatory variables. The second stage fulfills the long short-term memory (LSTM) network structure, capturing the residuals from the first estimation stage in order to enhance the forecasting performance. The proposed stepwise modeling approach (LR-LSTM) forecasts the demand of taxi rides, and it is implemented in the application of pick-up demand prediction using New York City (NYC) taxi data. The experiment result indicates that the integrated model can capture the inter-relationships between existing taxis and ride-hailing services as well as identify the influence of additional factors, namely, the day of the week, weather, and holidays. Overall, this modeling approach can be applied to construct an effective active demand management (ADM) for the short-term period as well as a quota control strategy between on-demand ride-hailing services and traditional taxis.}

abstract = {With an increased focus on minimising traffic externalities in metropolitan areas, a growing interest in environmentally friendly mobility systems has emerged, such as electric car-sharing systems. However, increasing demand and larger service areas often make it difficult to keep cars available where and when customers need them. This problem can be alleviated by predicting for how long cars stay vacant at given pick-up/drop-off locations. To maximise their usage, shared fleet operators relocate the cars to more desired locations. In this paper, we tackle the problem of predicting time to pick-up for shared cars in a probabilistic way by applying time-to-event modelling through survival analysis. Both statistical and machine learning approaches to survival regression are investigated. In addition, we propose the use of Gaussian copulas in order to model the correlation among vacant vehicles and to obtain more refined event-based predictions. First, an exploratory analysis is done to investigate the effect of various features on car vacancy time, which can provide significant insights into vacancy times and their influencing factors. Second, the Cox proportional hazards model (CPH), a linear survival model, is compared to DeepSurv, a neural-network-based survival model. To predict survival times, a two-step approach is formulated: in the upper level, a classification model is used to classify cars based on vacancy time duration and, in the lower level, time-to-event modelling is applied to each class using independent survival analysis models. Our empirical results using data from Copenhagen demonstrate that the DeepSurv model leads to a stronger fit compared to CPH. Moreover, we were able to verify that the proposed two-step approach can result in an improvement of over 15% in performance compared to a standard one-step approach. Lastly, we demonstrate the benefits of survival models for relocation optimisation.}

Large-scale LPR systems have seen rapid development in many parts of the world. However, limited by privacy considerations, LPR data are seldom available to the research community, which lead to huge research gap in data-driven applications. In this study, we propose a complete solution using LPR data for link-based traffic state estimation and prediction for arterial networks. The proposed integrative data-driven framework provides the inference of both cycle maximum queue length states and average travel times of links using LPR data from a subset of intersections in an arterial network. The framework contains three novel data-driven sub-components that are highly customized based on the characteristics of LPR data, including: a traffic signal timing inference model to find signal timing information from the LPR timestamp sequences; a light-weighted queue length approximation model to estimate lane-based cycle maximum queue lengths and a network-wide traffic state inference model to perform network-level estimation and prediction using partially observed data. This study exploits and utilizes the unique features of LPR data and other similar vehicle re-identification data for urban network-wide link-based traffic state estimation and prediction. A six days’ LPR dataset from a small road network in the city of Langfang in China and a more comprehensive link-level field experiment dataset are used to validate the model. Numerical results show that the framework provides good estimation and prediction accuracy. The proposed framework is efficient and calibration-free, which can be easily implemented in urban networks for various real-time traffic monitoring and control applications.}

The paper presents a new modeling framework that is able to simulate temporal information associated with the traveler’s daily activity schedule, for use in activity-based travel demand modeling. We employed a precise and efficient machine learning technique known as Random-Forest for temporal attribute recognition. In order to capture the uncertainty of start time and activity duration, initially we derived unique clusters of homogeneous daily activity patterns from the activity data. The Random-Forest model is formulated based on the socio-demographic characteristics of travelers and temporal features of their activities. Start time and activity duration for every activity type were allocated to a set of bins. In this study, eight different bin structures, varying in the time interval, are designed as response variables. Using a heuristic decision rule-based algorithm, the predicted activities were inserted into the traveler’s skeleton schedule. An algorithm was then applied to schedule travelers’ activities based on activity importance level and guide information gained from representative patterns for homogeneous population cohorts. The model was tested using time-diary data drawn from the Space-Time Activity Research (STAR) survey for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Results show that the proposed model is able to assemble the traveler’s schedule with an average 81.62% accuracy in the 24-hour period. The insights gained from this study include important temporal information on activities crucial for the scheduling stage of an activity-based model. Finally, the results of this paper are expected to be implemented within the activity-based travel demand model, Scheduler for Activities, Locations, and Travel (SALT).}

Conventionally, vehicles are classified by size, the number of axles or engine types, e.g., standard passenger cars versus trucks. However, vehicle flow heterogeneity stems from many other aspects in general, e.g., ride-sourcing vehicles versus personal vehicles, human driven vehicles versus connected and automated vehicles. Provided with some observations of vehicular flow for each class in a large-scale transportation network, how to estimate the multi-class spatio-temporal vehicular flow, in terms of time-varying Origin-Destination (OD) demand and path/link flow, remains a big challenge. This paper presents a solution framework for multi-class dynamic OD demand estimation (MCDODE) in large-scale networks that work for any vehicular data in general. The proposed framework cast the standard OD estimation methods into a computational graph with tensor representations of spatio-temporal flow and all intermediate features involved in the MCDODE formulation. A forward-backward algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the MCDODE formulation on computational graphs. In addition, we propose a novel concept of tree-based cumulative curves to compute the exact multi-class Dynamic Assignment Ratio (DAR) matrix. A Growing Tree algorithm is developed to construct tree-based cumulative curves. The proposed framework is examined on a small network, a mid-size network as well as a real-world large-scale network. The experiment results indicate that the proposed framework is compelling, satisfactory and computationally plausible.}

Researchers and policymakers envision that AV deployment will change transportation, development patterns, and other urban systems. Researchers have examined AVs and their potential impacts with two methods: (1) survey-based studies of AV preferences and (2) simulation-based estimation of secondary impacts of varied AV deployment strategies, such as Shared AVs (SAVs) and Privately-owned AVs (PAVs). While the preference survey literature can inform AV simulation studies, preference study results have so far not been integrated into simulation-based research. This lack of integration stems from the absence of data that measure preferences towards PAVs and SAVs at the neighborhood level. Existing preference studies usually investigate adoption likelihood without collecting appropriate information to link preferences to precise locations or neighborhoods. This study develops a microsimulation approach, incorporating machine learning and population synthesizing, to fill this data gap, leveraging a national AV perception survey (NAVPS) and the latest National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data. The model is applied to San Francisco, CA, and Austin, TX, to test the concept. We validate the proposed model by comparing the spatial distributions of synthesized ride-hailing users and observed ride-hailing trips. High correlations between our synthesized user density and empirical trip distributions in two study areas, to some extent, verify our proposed modeling approach.}

Although their apparent use has mostly been limited to image recognition and classification in recent years, generative machine learning algorithms can be a powerful tool for travel behaviour research by replicating travel behaviour by the underlying properties of data structures. In this paper, we examine the use of generative machine learning approach for analyzing multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) travel behaviour data. We provide a plausible perspective of how we can exploit the use of machine learning techniques to interpret the underlying heterogeneities in the data. We show that generative models are conceptually similar to the choice selection behaviour process through information entropy and variational Bayesian inference. Without loss of generality, we consider a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) based algorithm with multiple discrete-continuous layers, formulated as a variational Bayesian inference optimization problem. We systematically describe the proposed machine learning algorithm and develop a process of analyzing travel behaviour data from a generative learning perspective. We show parameter stability from model analysis and simulation tests on an open dataset with multiple discrete-continuous dimensions from a data size of 293,330 observations. For interpretability, we derive the conditional probabilities, elasticities and perform statistical analysis on the latent variables. We show that our model can generate statistically similar data distributions for travel forecasting and prediction and performs better than purely discriminative methods in validation. Our results indicate that latent constructs in generative models can accurately represent the joint distribution consistently on MDC data.}

Uncertainties in the airborne phase have significantly less impact on flight punctuality than deviations in aircraft ground operations. The ground trajectory of an aircraft primarily consists of the handling processes at the stand, defined as the aircraft turnaround, which are mainly controlled by operational experts. Only the aircraft boarding, which is on the critical path of the turnaround, is driven by the passengers’ experience and willingness or ability to follow the proposed procedures. We used a recurrent neural network approach to predict the progress of a running boarding event. In particular, we implemented and trained the Long Short-Term Memory model. Since no operational data of the specific passenger behavior is available, we used a reliable, validated boarding simulation environment to provide data about the aircraft boarding events. First predictions show that uni-variate input (seat load progress) produces insufficient results, so we consider expected passenger interactions in the aircraft cabin as well. These interactions are aggregated to a prior-developed complexity metric and allow an efficient evaluation of the current boarding progress. With this multi-variate input, our Long Short-Term Memory model achieves appropriate prediction results for the boarding progress.}

In the proposed approach, a novel use of risk-averse and hybrid prediction methodology controls the underestimation of defects. Then, a discounted Markov decision process model utilizes these predictions to determine optimal inspection and maintenance scheduling policies. Furthermore, in the presence of capacity constraints, Whittle indices via the multi-armed restless bandit formulation dynamically provide the optimal policies using the updated transition kernels.

This paper demonstrates that DNNs can provide economic information as complete as classical discrete choice models (DCMs). The economic information from DNNs includes choice predictions, choice probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns of alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities, marginal rates of substitution, and heterogeneous values of time. Unlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn utility functions and reveal behavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts, particularly when the sample size is large. However, the economic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable when the sample size is small, because of three challenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. The first challenge is related to the statistical challenge of balancing approximation and estimation errors of DNNs, the second to the optimization challenge of identifying the global optimum in the DNN training, and the third to the robustness challenge of mitigating locally irregular patterns of estimated functions. To demonstrate the strength and challenges, we estimated the DNNs using a stated preference survey from Singapore and a revealed preference data from London, extracted the full list of economic information from the DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the economic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more reliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or trainings, and that larger sample size, hyperparameter searching, model ensemble, and effective regularization can significantly improve the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs. Future studies should investigate the requirement of sample size, better ensemble mechanisms, other regularizations and DNN architectures, better optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address DNNs three challenges to provide more reliable economic information for DNN-based choice models.}

While this type of mobility data adds significant value to various analyses, one challenge that persists is lack of information about the types of vehicles that performed the recorded trips, which clearly limits the value of trajectory data in transportation system analysis. To overcome this limitation of trajectory data, a deep Convolutional Neural Network for Vehicle Classification (CNN-VC) is proposed to identify the vehicle’s class from its trajectory. This paper proposes a novel representation of GPS trajectories, which is not only compatible with deep learning models, but also captures both vehicle-motion characteristics and roadway features. To this end, an open source navigation system is also exploited to obtain more accurate information on travel time and distance between GPS coordinates. Before delving into training the CNN-VC model, an efficient programmatic strategy is also designed to label large-scale GPS trajectories by means of vehicle information obtained through Virtual Weigh Station records. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed CNN-VC model consistently outperforms both classical machine learning algorithms and other deep learning baseline methods. From a practical perspective, the CNN-VC model allows us to label raw GPS trajectories with vehicle classes, thereby enriching the data and enabling more comprehensive transportation studies such as derivation of vehicle class-specific origin-destination tables that can be used for planning.}

It can be divided in two parts, a digraph-based representation for hybrid urban traffic network and a Dirgraph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCN)-based learning model. At first, the representation incorporates the fundamental traffic variables with the correlation of different traffic flows, and partially decouples the global network topology from local traffic information. And then, to proceed with digraph-based samples, a new type of graph feature extraction method is introduced and the graph Fourier transform is defined accordingly. This distinguishes the proposed model from the conventional graph convolutional networks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted based on real traffic data.

Then, a vision-based intention inference system is proposed, which captures the multi-modal signals based on multiple low-cost cameras and the VBOX vehicle data acquisition system. A novel ensemble bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units is proposed to deal with the time-series driving sequence and the temporal behavioral patterns. Naturalistic highway driving data that consists of lane-keeping, left and right lane change maneuvers are collected and used for model construction and evaluation. Furthermore, the driver's pre-maneuver activities are statistically analyzed. It is found that for situation-aware, drivers usually check the mirrors for more than six seconds before they initiate the lane change maneuver, and the time interval between steering the handwheel and crossing the lane is about 2 s on average. Finally, hypothesis testing is conducted to show the significant improvement of the proposed algorithm over existing ones. With five-fold cross-validation, the EBiLSTM model achieves an average accuracy of 96.1% for the intention that is inferred 0.5 s before the maneuver starts.}

This paper proposes a novel method to infer the trip purpose attribute from the sequences of trips of passengers instead of separate trips. The proposed method infers the trip purpose attribute (a missing attribute in the smart card data) from the temporal attributes (available attributes in the smart card data). First, the relation between the temporal attributes and the trip purpose attribute is learnt by discovering clusters of passengers in the Household Travel Survey dataset while each passenger is represented by one sequence of trips. Then, the discovered clusters are utilized to infer the trip purpose of smart card transactions by allocating each passenger to the closest clusters. The proposed method is implemented on the smart card and HTS datasets from southeast Queensland, Australia. The evaluation results showed a considerable improvement in inferring the trip purpose compared to the results published in the literature.

Using foot-by-foot track geometry and tonnage data, this paper develops a new machine learning based approach to identify the track geometry parameters that contribute most to the prediction of rail defects occurrences. Taking more than 60 types of track geometry measurements into account, this study develops a Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm for feature selection and compares its results with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In addition, to capture more knowledge from the geometry data, some additional features, including Track Quality Index (TQI), energy spectral density, and time-trend are extracted. This, in turn, facilitates the learning and predicting process. Moreover, since there exists a very limited number of rail defects, the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN) is applied to overcome the issue of imbalance in the dataset. In terms of machine learning algorithms, the proposed approach employs an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in which the hyper-parameters are optimized using a Bayesian optimization method. Furthermore, the proposed approach investigates the impact of each track geometry parameter as well as a subset of them on rail defects occurrences with Partial Dependence Analysis (PDA).

abstract = {Air Traffic Management is evolving towards a Trajectory-Based Operations paradigm. Trajectory prediction will hold a key role supporting its deployment, but it is limited by a lack of understanding of air traffic associated uncertainties, specifically contextual factors. Trajectory predictors are usually based on modelling aircraft dynamics based on intrinsic aircraft features. These aircraft operate within a known air route structure and under given meteorological conditions. However, actual aircraft trajectories are modified by the air traffic control depending on potential conflicts with other traffics. This paper introduces surrounding air traffic as a feature for ground-based trajectory prediction. The introduction of air traffic as a contextual factor is addressed by identifying aircraft which are likely to lose the horizontal separation. For doing so, this paper develops a probabilistic horizontal interdependency measure between aircraft supported by machine learning algorithms, addressing time separations at crossing points. Then, vertical profiles of flight trajectories are characterised depending on this factor and other intrinsic features. The paper has focused on the descent phase of the trajectories, using datasets corresponding to an en-route Spanish airspace volume. The proposed interdependency measure demonstrates to identify in advance conflicting situations between pairs of aircraft for this use case. This is validated by identifying associated air traffic control actions upon them and their impact on the vertical profile of the trajectories. Finally, a trajectory predictor for the vertical profile of the trajectory is developed, considering the interdependency measure and other operational factors. The paper concludes that the air traffic can be included as a factor for the trajectory prediction, impacting on the location of the top of descent for the specific case which has been studied.}

In this work, we have demonstrated that the developed machine learning algorithm as an inverse problem solver can accurately identify initial collision conditions in an inverse manner, which are practically unique if we use permanent plastic deformation as the forensic data signatures. In other words, we think that the massive plastic energy dissipation process and the related big data will make final structure damage state insensitive to the initial car collision conditions. Thus, it provides an inverse solution for car crash forensic analysis by reconstructing the initial failure load parameters and conditions based on the permanent plastic deformation distribution of cars. This approach has general significance in solving the inverse problem for engineering failure analysis and vehicle crashworthiness analysis, which provides a key contribution for the unmanned autonomous vehicle and the related technology.}

While many studies accomplished traffic forecasting task with deep learning models, there is still an open issue of exploiting spatial-temporal traffic state features for better prediction performance, and the model interpretability has not been taken serious. In this study, we propose a path based deep learning framework which can produce better traffic speed prediction at a city wide scale, furthermore, the model is both rational and interpretable in the context of urban transportation. Specifically, we divide the road network into critical paths, which is helpful to mine the traffic flow mechanism. Then, each critical path is modeled through the bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (Bi-LSTM NN), and multiple Bi-LSTM layers are stacked to incorporate temporal information. At the stage of traffic prediction, the spatial-temporal features captured from these processes are fed into a fully-connected layer. Finally, results for each path are ensembled for network-wise traffic speed prediction. In the empirical studies, we compare the proposed model with multiple benchmark methods. Under a series of prediction scenarios (i.e., different input and prediction horizons), the superior performance of the proposed framework is validated. Moreover, by analyzing feature from hidden-layer output, the study explains the physical meaning of the hidden feature and illustrate model’s interpretability.}

It forecasts a congestion score, defined as the ratio of the vehicle accumulation inside a neighborhood to its trip completion rate. Inputs include congestion scores measured at earlier times in neighborhoods within a region, and three other real-time measures of regional traffic. The ideas are tested using Newell’s simplified theory of kinematic waves. Simplified street networks are featured first. Initial tests demonstrate the suitability of the congestion score for characterizing neighborhood traffic conditions, and that the score can be predicted using the four inputs. Further tests of the simplified networks illustrate the value of the deep learning approach, as compared against the use of three benchmark models. A next round of tests shows that the model can be made robust, even to adverse settings. A final round of tests features a pared-down version of the freeway network in the San Francisco Bay Area. The final tests show that the model is scalable. The model is thereafter improved by representing the inputs through weighted undirected graphs that incorporate the route-choice of individuals, and learning features through graph convolutions. A framework for better interpreting the contributions of the model’s inputs to its output is developed. A demonstration of the model’s usefulness in designing traffic control schemes is presented as well.}

If these estimates are not accurate, the level of service is degraded, as the promised time window may not be satisfied. The purpose of this work is to assess the feasibility of machine learning techniques to predict stop delivery times. This is done by testing a wide range of machine learning techniques (including different types of ensembles) to (1) predict the stop delivery time and (2) to determine whether the total stop delivery time will exceed a predefined time threshold (classification approach). For the assessment, all models are trained using information generated from GPS data collected in Medellín, Colombia and compared to hazard duration models. The results are threefold. First, the assessment shows that regression-based machine learning approaches are not better than conventional hazard duration models concerning absolute errors of the prediction of the stop delivery times. Second, when the problem is addressed by a classification scheme in which the prediction is aimed to guide whether a stop time will exceed a predefined time, a basic K-nearest-neighbor model outperforms hazard duration models and other machine learning techniques both in accuracy and F1 score (harmonic mean between precision and recall). Third, the prediction of the exact duration can be improved by combining the classifiers and prediction models or hazard duration models in a two level scheme (first classification then prediction). However, the improvement depends largely on the correct classification (first level).}

Many features impact on taxi time, including the route taken, aircraft category, operational mode of the airport, traffic congestion information, and local weather conditions. Working with real-world data for several international airports, we compare multiple prediction models and investigate the impact of these features, drawing conclusions on the most important features for accurately modelling taxi times. We show that high accuracy can be achieved with a small subset of the features consisting of those generally important across all airports (departure/arrival, distance, total turns, average speed and numbers of recent aircraft), and a small number of features specific to particular target airports. Moving from all features to this small subset results in less than a 1 percentage-point drop in movements correctly predicted within 1, 3 and 5 min.}

In this article, we introduce a new Cooperative Group-Based Multi-Agent reinforcement learning-ATSC (CGB-MATSC) framework. It is based on Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System (CVIS) to realize effective control in the large-scale road network.

We further compare the seq2seq model with a classical car-following model (IDM) and a deep learning car-following model (LSTM). The evaluation results indicate that the proposed model outperforms others for reproducing trajectory and capturing heterogeneous driving behaviors. Moreover, the platoon simulation demonstrates that the proposed model can well reproduce different levels of hysteresis phenomenon. The proposed model is further extended with spatial anticipation, which improves platoon simulation accuracy and traffic flow stability.}

The space-based ADS-B system can receive and send the flight position of the aircraft over the ocean area. In this paper, the ocean tracks in space-based ADS-B data are first extracted. According to the different route structures, the data of fixed route and flexible route are preprocessed by segmented Kalman filter and cubic polynomial fitting method respectively. Then the processed track position error is calculated, and Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) median method is used to test the normal distribution of the error, and k-means clustering is used to obtain the clustering center and occurrence frequency of positioning error and flight error. Finally, a collision risk model based on Bayesian network is established, and the error distribution parameters and occurrence frequency are brought into the model to evaluate the collision risk of parallel routes in the ocean area. The results show that the lateral collision risk based on space-based ADS-B ocean flight data is lower than 0.5 × 10−8 times/hour specified by ICAO when the fixed route separation is 14n miles and the flexible route separation is 49n miles. And the actual lateral interval of the Pacific flexible route is 50n miles (Jiang, 2010), which meets the safety target level.}

It is a fundamental problem in the modeling of transportation where the synthetic populations of micro-agents represent a key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological framework for how to ‘grow’ pools of micro-agents is presented. The model framework adopts a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Compared to the previous population synthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs sampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden Markov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution for high dimensions. The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional Gibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by using a large-scale Danish trip diary. It is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE in the low-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number of modeled attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler essentially replicates the agents from the original sample when the required conditional distributions are estimated as frequency tables. In contrast, the VAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents that are virtually different from those in the original data but have similar statistical properties. The presented approach can support agent-based modeling at all levels by enabling richer synthetic populations with smaller zones and more detailed individual characteristics.}

Data collected from on-board recorders in commercial aircraft contain thousands of parameters in the form of multivariate time-series (continuous, discrete, categorical, etc.) which are used to train the machine learning models. Among the phases of flight, approach and landing phases result in the most accidents and incidents. The performance and trajectory of the aircraft during the approach phase is an indicator of its landing performance which, in turn, affects incident or accident probability such as runway excursions. Landing performance is commonly measured using metrics such as landing airspeed, vertical speed, location of touchdown point on runway, etc. While current applications of machine learning to aviation focus on retrospective insights to implement corrective measures, they offer limited value for real-time risk identification or decision-making as they are inherently reactive in nature. In this work, a novel offline-online framework is developed for building a global predictive model offline to predict landing performance metrics online. The framework leverages flight data from the approach phase between certain approach altitudes (also called gates) in order to train the offline model to predict the landing true airspeed and ground speed using a Random Forest regression algorithm. Permutation importance is used to identify and retain important features among those available and the training data is balanced with respect to flight safety events to ensure a good performing model. The developed global model is robust and can predict landing true airspeed and ground speed with root mean square errors of 2.62 and 2.98 knots respectively over six different airframes operating at over seventy airports. The model operates fast in prediction mode which, coupled with the ability to provide the prediction at an altitude where a go-around decision may be made, makes it particularly suitable for online application. The framework is demonstrated using data obtained from commercial airline operations that contains thousands of flight records and performs better than existing techniques in literature at predicting true airspeed and ground speed at touchdown.}

This study attempts to bridge the research gap by predicting signal cycle-level through and left-turn movements in real-time at signalized intersections. The utilized data were limited to the upstream and downstream intersections at the corridor level. Aiming to achieve this objective, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models were developed using datsets that contain variables from different number of utilized cycles (4, 6, and 8 cycles). The three models were evaluated by calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results showed that the performance measures for the three models were close. Meanwhile. the GRU model using variables from six previous cycles outperformed the others. This modelling approach was followed to predict traffic movements for different time horizons (five cycles ahead). The performance measures values were close for the five predicted cycles. It is expected that the model could help in obtaining accurate traffic movement at intersections, which could be used for adjusting adaptive signal timing and improve signal and intersections’ efficiency.}

Whether the cameras are mounted on drones, vehicles, or fixed in the built environments, they inevitably remain scatter. We need to develop the technology to re-identify the same agents across images captured from non-overlapping field-of-views, referred to as the visual re-identification task. State-of-the-art methods learn a neural network based representation trained with the cross-entropy loss function. We argue that such loss function is not suited for the visual re-identification task hence propose to model confidence in the representation learning framework.

abstract = {Travel mode identification is among the key problems in transportation research. With the gradual and rapid adoption of GPS-enabled smart devices in modern society, this task greatly benefits from the massive volume of GPS trajectories generated.

In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep ensemble learning approach for travel mode identification to use a minimal number of annotated data for the task. The proposed approach accepts GPS trajectories of arbitrary lengths and extracts their latent information with a tailor-made feature engineering process. We devise a new deep neural network architecture to establish the mapping from this latent information domain to the final travel mode domain. An ensemble is accordingly constructed to develop proxy labels for unannotated data based on the rare annotated ones so that both types of data contribute to the learning process. Comprehensive case studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed approach, which notably outperforms existing ones with partially-labeled training data. Furthermore, we investigate its robustness to noisy data and the effectiveness of its constituting components.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel deep learning-based travel behaviour choice model. Our proposed Residual Logit (ResLogit) model formulation seamlessly integrates a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture into a multinomial logit model. Recently, DNN models such as the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have shown remarkable success in modelling complex and noisy behavioural data. However, econometric studies have argued that machine learning techniques are a ‘black-box’ and difficult to interpret for use in the choice analysis. We develop a data-driven choice model that extends the systematic utility function to incorporate non-linear cross-effects using a series of residual layers and using skipped connections to handle model identifiability in estimating a large number of parameters. The model structure accounts for cross-effects and choice heterogeneity arising from substitution, interactions with non-chosen alternatives and other effects in a non-linear manner. We describe the formulation, model estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance and econometric implications of our proposed model. We present an illustrative example of the model on a classic red/blue bus choice scenario example. For a real-world application, we use a travel mode choice dataset to analyze the model characteristics compared to traditional neural networks and Logit formulations. Our findings show that our ResLogit approach significantly outperforms MLP models while providing similar interpretability as a Multinomial Logit model.}

We propose two deep learning models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with self-attention mechanism—namely, hybrid LSTM and sequential LSTM. These models capture patterns in location and time sequences in trajectory data and their dependencies to predict next locations and travel times simultaneously. Using Bluetooth vehicle trajectory data from Brisbane, Australia, we compare the prediction performance of the proposed models with several existing approaches including hidden Markov model and other LSTM-based models. The results show that the proposed models produce higher prediction accuracy for both location and time prediction tasks, with the sequential LSTM yielding the best performance. Compared to the conventional next location prediction problem, which considers location sequences only without travel time consideration, the study finds that jointly modelling location and travel time sequences actually improves the next location prediction performance itself, potentially because travel time observations capture the information on traffic conditions in the network, which may affect drivers’ location choices. We demonstrate an application of the proposed models in network traffic management, where important locations can be identified to mitigate congestion in a hot-spot by predicting where vehicles come from and go next in an urban road network.}

It is the first-of-its-kind survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both transportation engineering and AI for mixed traffic modeling. We will discuss state-of-the-art applications of AI-guided methods, identify opportunities and obstacles, and raise open questions. We divide the stage of AV deployment into four phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AV-dominated, and the pure AVs. This paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. Models used for each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep (reinforcement) learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we primarily focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving policies are to control a large number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate human driver behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled in the environment? (4) How are the interactions between human drivers and autonomous vehicles characterized? We also provide a list of public datasets and simulation software related to AVs. Hopefully this paper will not only inspire our transportation community to rethink the conventional models that are developed in the data-shortage era, but also start conversations with other disciplines, in particular robotics and machine learning, to join forces towards creating a safe and efficient mixed traffic ecosystem.}

This paper presents a flexible framework to automatically extract these interaction patterns from observed temporal sequences based on driving primitives. A Bayesian nonparametric approach is developed to segment vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) sequential observations into small analytically interpretable components (called driving primitives) without using prior knowledge. Then, an unsupervised clustering method is developed to gather these driving primitives into groups (called driving patterns) by integrating with dynamic time warping. In addition, the extracted driving primitives are used to quantitatively analyze the similarities between behaviors at different intersections using a relative entropy metric, i.e., KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence. Finally, 706 naturalistic V2V events from eight typical urban signalized intersections are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed primitive-based framework. Experimental results demonstrate that there exist 15 types of interactive driving patterns for V2V behaviors at intersections in our database. Moreover, the distribution of interactive driving patterns could characterize the types of intersections.}

In this study, we develop an innovative data-driven approach for devising efficient vehicle relocation policy for OMS that (1) proactively relocates vehicles before the demand is observed and (2) reduces the inequality among drivers’ income so that the proactive relocation policy is fair and is likely to be followed by drivers. Our approach represents the fusion of optimization and machine learning methods, which comprises three steps: First, we formulate the optimal proactive relocation as an optimal/stable matching problems and solve for global optimal solutions based on historical data. Second, the optimal solutions are then grouped and fed to train the deep learning models which consist of fully connected layers and long short-term memory networks. Low rank approximation is introduced to reduce the model complexity and improve the training performances. Finally, we use the trained model to predict the relocation policy which can be implemented in real time. We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the performances of the proposed method using New York City taxi data. The results suggest that our method will reduce empty mileage per trip by 54–70% under the optimal matching strategy, and a 25–32% reduction can also be achieved by following the stable matching strategy. We also validate that the predicted relocation policies are robust in the presence of uncertain passenger demand level and passenger trip-requesting behavior.}

The use of such services may be associated with car-light or car-free lifestyles. However, there are growing concerns regarding their impact on urban transportation operations performance due to empty, unproductive miles driven without a passenger (commonly referred to as deadheading). This paper is motivated by the potential to reduce deadhead mileage of ridesourcing trips by providing drivers with information on future ridesourcing trip demand. Future demand information enables the driver to wait in place for the next rider’s request without cruising around and contributing to congestion. A machine learning model is employed to predict hourly and 10-minute future interval travel demand for ridesourcing at a given location. Using future demand information, we propose algorithms to (i) assign drivers to act on received demand information by waiting in place for the next rider, and (ii) match these drivers with riders to minimize deadheading distance. Real-world data from ridesourcing providers in Austin, TX (RideAustin) and Chengdu, China (DiDi Chuxing) are leveraged. Results show that this process achieves 68%–82% and 53%–60% reduction of trip-level deadheading miles for the RideAustin and DiDi Chuxing sample operations respectively, under the assumption of unconstrained availability of short-term parking. Deadheading savings increase slightly as the maximum tolerable waiting time for the driver increases. Further, it is observed that significant deadhead savings per trip are possible, even when a small percent of the ridesourcing driver pool is provided with future ridesourcing demand information.}

Such stop-scale approaches ignore the fact that delays are also caused and perpetuated by network-wide factors (e.g., bottlenecks caused by shared tracks by multiple transit lines). The objective of this paper is to develop a network model and metrics that can quantify the delay dependencies between transit network stops, and identify local sources of network-wide issues. For this purpose, Bayesian network learning (at the intersection of machine learning and network science) was utilized. Based on the calculated Bayesian networks (BNs), network metrics (inducer and susceptible) were formulated to quantify the network-wide impacts of the delays experienced at the stops. To implement the proposed framework, the delays at Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) were gathered through a crowdsourced real-time transit information app called onTime. The developed BN model was tested through cross-validation, yielded promising accuracy results, successfully identified the problematic stops based on LIRR reports, and provided further insights on network impacts. The BN model and the developed metrics were further tested using a natural experiment, i.e., a before and after study focusing on a recently completed track expansion project at LIRR. The findings imply that BN learning can successfully identify the network dependencies and indicate the rail links/corridors that are the best candidate for subsequent improvement investments. Overall, the developed metrics can quantify the delay dependencies between stops and they can be used by policy makers and practitioners for investment and improvement decisions.}

In this study, we developed a reinforcement learning-based approach for modeling and simulation of people mass movement using the global positioning system (GPS) data. Unlike traditional travel demand modeling approaches, our method focuses on the problem of inferring the spatio-temporal preferences of individuals from the observed trajectories, and is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques. We applied the model to the data collected from a smartphone application and attempted to replicate a large amount of the population’s daily movement by incorporating with agent-based multi-modal traffic simulation technologies.

abstract = {Bus bunching has been a long-standing problem that undermines the efficiency and reliability of public transport services. The most popular countermeasure in practice is to introduce static and dynamic holding control. However, most previous holding control strategies mainly consider local information with a pre-specified headway/schedule, while the global coordination of the whole bus fleet and its long-term effect are often overlooked. To efficiently incorporate global coordination and long-term operation in bus holding, in this paper we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) framework to develop dynamic and flexible holding control strategies for a bus route. Specifically, we model each bus as an agent that interacts with not only its leader/follower but also all other vehicles in the fleet. To better explore potential strategies, we develop an effective headway-based reward function in the proposed framework. In the learning framework, we model fleet coordination by using a basic actor-critic scheme along with a joint action tracker to better characterize the complex interactions among agents in policy learning, and we apply proximal policy optimization to improve learning performance. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the proposed MDRL framework against multiple baseline models that only rely on local information. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework and show the promise of applying MDRL in the coordinative control of public transport vehicle fleets in real-world operations.}

Leveraging spatial–temporal data from multiple sources for (citywide) traffic forecasting is a key to strengthen the smart city management in areas such as urban traffic control, abnormal event detection, etc. Existing approaches of traffic flow prediction mainly rely on the development of various deep neural networks –e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks such as ResNet are used for modeling spatial dependencies among different regions, whereas recurrent neural networks are increasingly implemented for temporal dynamics modeling. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches suffer from limitations of intensive computations, lack of capabilities to properly deal with missing values, and simplistic integration of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel urban flow prediction framework by generalizing the hidden states of the model with continuous-time dynamics of the latent states using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we introduce a discretize-then-optimize approach to improve and balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. It not only guarantees the prediction error but also provides high flexibility for decision-makers. Furthermore, we investigate the factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that affect the city traffic volume and use separate neural networks to extract and disentangle the influencing factors, which avoids the brute-force data fusion in previous works. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, while requiring significantly less memory cost and fewer model parameters.}

The experiment results show that the postprocessing the residuals of Neural Network by the ARIMA analysis helps to significantly improve accuracy of traffic state prediction by 8.9–13.4% in term of mean squared error reduction.

There is an emerging trend of using reinforcement learning methods for VSL control. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to develop autonomous control agents for problems that were previously intractable. In this paper, a more effective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is developed for differential variable speed limit (DVSL) control, in which dynamic and distinct speed limits among lanes can be imposed. The proposed DRL model uses a novel actor-critic architecture to learn a large number of discrete speed limits in a continuous action space. Different reward signals, such as total travel time, bottleneck speed, emergency braking, and vehicular emissions are used to train the DVSL controller, and a comparison between these reward signals is conducted. The proposed DRL-based DVSL controllers are tested on a freeway with a simulated recurrent bottleneck. The simulation results show that the DRL based DVSL control strategy is able to improve the safety, efficiency and environment-friendliness of the freeway. In order to verify whether the controller generalizes to real world implementation, we also evaluate the generalization of the controllers on environments with different driving behavior attributes. and the robustness of the DRL agent is observed from the results.}

As users handle smartphones for various purposes and their preferences determine different device positions while traveling, accelerometer and gyroscope, for instance, often present ambiguities that prevent accurate stop detection. To mitigate the impact of these ambiguities, we combine spatial time-series, i.e. GPS, with spatial context information retrieved from Open Street Map, which we represent as multi-dimension tensors. This project explores simple representations, such as dummy variables, and novel multidimensional representations, which are bench-marked through the classification performance of specialized artificial neural network (ANN), as well as other machine learning (ML) baselines.

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of smart, personal technologies has given birth to smart Transportation Demand Management (TDM) systems that can give personalized incentives to users. This personalization capacity builds on accurate modeling of user behaviors; however, in practice, a user’s behavior data is often limited, and his preferences in the discrete choice-making process may change or evolve. In this paper, we propose a new online-updating model that can accurately and efficiently estimate an individual’s preferences from his discrete choices. Our model is built on the concept of canonical structure, where a set of canonical models are identified as the common preference patterns shared by the whole population, and a membership vector is also identified for each individual to capture the degrees of the resemblance of his preferences to those common preference patterns. To allow preference to vary in the choice-making process, a time-varying model can be integrated with the canonical structure. In the current study, we use a simple cubic polynomial model with a single variant and show the detailed formulation of the integrated model. An online-updating strategy is also proposed, such that it is possible to update the parameters partially in practice. The proposed model is suitable for modeling a heterogeneous population with insufficient data from each individual. Both simulation studies and a real-world application are taken in the current study. The results show that comparing with other frequently used models, the model we proposed has the highest accuracy in preference learning and behavior prediction.}

abstract = {Vehicle energy consumption and powertrain operations for future vehicle powertrain technologies are predicted through full-vehicle simulations using Autonomie, a simulation tool developed at Argonne National Laboratory. Over 1 million vehicles, with different powertrain types (conventional and numerous electrified powertrains) and component technologies (advanced engines, batteries, electrical machines, light weighting) are simulated for outputs including vehicle fuel economy and cost. Despite the ability of Autonomie to predict fuel economy given various combination of vehicle inputs, the full-vehicle simulation is very time-consuming. It takes approximately 84 h to simulate for 33,060 vehicles even using distributed computing on a cluster of 128 worker nodes. Moreover, Autonomie is unable to populate a continuous output space through simulation since it only yields outputs with discrete values instead of an input-output relation. This paper proposes a novel large-scale learning and prediction process (LSLPP) via machine learning approaches to answer the need for a continuous space of vehicle fuel economy and a more efficient simulation process. By learning in a supervised fashion to discover structures in data, the machine learning approaches seek to train a model that can explain the data with which we can perform prediction over unseen data. As such, we are able to accomplish analytic continuation on the current discrete space of simulation results. In addition, we present a random-sampling-based numerosity reduction algorithm incorporated in LSLPP that reduces simulation runs and improves efficiency of data procurement. We analytically derive a theoretical bound in order to guarantee the effectiveness of our algorithm. We also compare random sampling to stratified sampling and suggest sampling strategies. A user-friendly tool is developed to support the process. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed LSLPP is able to greatly accelerate prediction and analysis of vehicle fuel economy. The output of this study is used by the US government to evaluate the impact of its R&D funding on energy security and CO2 emission as well as for the setting of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.}

abstract = {Ride-hailing platforms generally provide various service options to customers, such as solo ride services, shared ride services, etc. It is generally expected that demands for different service modes are correlated, and the prediction of demand for one service mode can benefit from historical observations of demands for other service modes. Moreover, an accurate joint prediction of demands for multiple service modes can help the platforms better allocate and dispatch vehicle resources. Although there is a large stream of literature on ride-hailing demand predictions for one specific service mode, few efforts have been paid towards joint predictions of ride-hailing demands for multiple service modes. To address this issue, we propose a deep multi-task multi-graph learning approach, which combines two components: (1) multiple multi-graph convolutional (MGC) networks for predicting demands for different service modes, and (2) multi-task learning modules that enable knowledge sharing across multiple MGC networks. More specifically, two multi-task learning structures are established. The first one is the regularized cross-task learning, which builds cross-task connections among the inputs and outputs of multiple MGC networks. The second one is the multi-linear relationship learning, which imposes a prior tensor normal distribution on the weights of various MGC networks. Although there are no concrete bridges between different MGC networks, the weights of these networks are constrained by each other and subject to a common prior distribution. Evaluated with the for-hire-vehicle datasets in Manhattan, we show that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms in prediction accuracy for different ride-hailing modes.}

abstract = {Under increasing economic and environmental pressure, airlines are constantly seeking new technologies and optimizing flight operations to reduce fuel consumption. However, the current practice on fuel loading, which has a significant impact on aircraft weight and fuel consumption, has yet to be thoroughly addressed by existing studies. Excess fuel is loaded by dispatchers and (or) pilots to handle fuel consumption uncertainties, primarily caused by flight time uncertainties, which cannot be predicted by current Flight Planning Systems (FPS). In this paper, we develop a novel spatial weighted recurrent neural network model to provide better flight time predictions by capturing air traffic information at a national scale based on multiple data sources, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METAR), and airline records. In this model, a spatial weighted layer is designed to extract spatial dependences among network delay states (i.e. average flight delay at each airport and average flight delay of each Origin-Destination (OD) pair for a specific time interval). Then, a new training procedure associated with the spatial weighted layer is introduced to extract OD-specific spatial weights and then integrate into one model for a nationwide air traffic network. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used after the spatial weighted layer to extract the temporal behavior patterns of network delay states. Finally, features from delays, weather, and flight schedules are fed into a fully connected neural network to predict the flight time of a particular flight. The proposed model was evaluated using one year of historical data from an airline’s real operations. Results show that our model can provide a more accurate flight time predictions than baseline methods, especially for flights with extreme delays. We also show that, with the improved flight time prediction, fuel loading can be optimized and resulting reduced fuel consumption by 0.016%–1.915% without increasing the fuel depletion risk.}

However, the AVI observations are too sparse to infer the specific chosen route and OD pair, which discourages its application on route choice model estimation. To tackle this issue, this paper develops a semi-supervised learning method that can train the route choice model with sparse AVI observations. First of all, the likelihood function in Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure was derived by decomposing the AVI trace into observation pairs. Combined with high-resolution GPS observations, the measurement equation and OD inference model were then defined to deal with the sparsity problem of AVI observations. At the same time, the Mixed Logit model was introduced to capture the correlation and heterogeneity across the choice behavior between different observation pairs. Finally, the relationship between route choice model and the likelihood function was established and the unknown parameters in route choice model can be estimated by seeking a maximum to the log-likelihood function. Empirical studies were conducted with field-testing data in this paper. The estimated results show that the proposed semi-supervised method improved the identification accuracy of route choice model significantly without sacrificing interpretability. The evaluation of the computational efficiency presented the potential of the semi-supervised method to learn route choice behavior for a large-size sample set. The sensitivity analysis was also performed to illustrate how robust the proposed method is. This is the first research that attempts to apply AVI data on route choice model and it endows the high-penetration AVI data with great practical value for modeling the route choice behavior of city-wide samples over a long period.}

To date, driver trust in automated vehicle technologies has mostly been estimated by subjective data. Currently available objective measures of driver trust primarily rely on self-reported ratings as the ground truth, while the largely reported inconsistency between drivers’ self-reported trust levels and observed actual behavior suggests that drivers’ trust measures shall not solely rely on subjective reporting values. To address the issue, this study proposes an objective method to assess and predict driver trust in automated vehicle technologies, by using the transition probability matrix of drivers’ hand positions during automated vehicle system engagement. An on-road experiment was conducted on public roadways in real traffic. Data on use frequencies of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-reported trust ratings were collected and combined in classifying driver trust levels: lower, medium, and higher based on the K-means clustering results. Drivers’ hand positions during ADAS engagement (i.e., during lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist system uses) were then found closely associated with their trust levels. Differences of frequencies and transition probabilities for hand positions were further compared within and across the three trust groups. Results showed that drivers from the lower, medium, and higher trust groups were more likely to keep hands on the top, mid, and low positions of the wheel, respectively. Factors affecting driver trust in automated vehicle technologies were also explored through mixed model analyses. Middle-aged drivers placed more trust in ADAS than younger drivers, while female drivers exhibited greater trust than male drivers. The Random Forests algorithm was applied to build a prediction model for driver trust in automated vehicle technologies, by inputting the hand position transition probability matrix, age, gender, and ADAS types as independent variables. The overall prediction accuracy was approximately 80%. Findings in this study could contribute to the objective and real-time estimations of driver trust in automated vehicle technologies.}

This raises the importance of understanding public perceptions regarding safety considerations when traveling alongside AVs. This study makes use of a national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center to identify the affective, socio-demographic and technology-use attributes that affect an individual’s perception of the safety of sharing the road with AVs (PSSRAV) and identifies measures and interventions that can be undertaken to improve PSSRAV. Additionally, we evaluate individual preferences for AV regulations. Our results underscore the importance of the need for service providers and public agencies to be cognizant of the demographic and lifestyle/affective emotion considerations shaping AV safety perceptions and opinions about AV regulations. In particular, there is a need not only to focus on technological and other infrastructure components of AV development, but also to recognize the socio-technical considerations and human-related factors of the end-users. Our findings should be of substantial interest in the planning, design, deployment, and introduction of AVs within a safe and minimally regulated public operating arena.}

However, there are computational challenges for solving this Timetable Synchronization Problem (TSP) for large, real-world urban PT networks. Hence, in this study we propose a data-driven, passenger-oriented methodology as a preparatory selection stage to reduce problem dimensionality by (1) determining the significant transfer hubs in the network, and (2) identifying subsets of lines within these hubs that need to be prioritized for transfer synchronization. In the first phase of our methodology we determine the spatial boundaries of transfer locations, using a clustering technique based on the passenger transfer flow matrix inferred from smartcard data. After that, a subset of hubs to be prioritized for synchronization is selected. In the second phase, we characterize the transfer patterns within the hubs based on a topological representation. Based on these topological graphs, the line bundles that need to be prioritized within the hubs are further identified using a modularity-based community detection technique. We apply our methodology to a real-world case study, i.e. the PT network of The Hague, the Netherlands. For this case study, our approach allows for prioritizing 70% of all transfers within identified transfer locations while only requiring 0.9% of these transfer locations, thus reducing the complexity of solving the TSP substantially at a relatively low cost. Our method supports public transport operators during timetable design and real-time control in determining where and which lines to prioritize when devising measures for improving transfer experience and synchronization.}

In parallel, mobile phone data have emerged as the largest mobility data source, but are not yet integrated to transport planning models. Currently, transport authorities are lacking a global picture of daily passenger flows on multimodal transport networks. In this work, we propose the first methodology to infer dynamic Origin-Destination flows by transport modes using mobile network data e.g., Call Detail Records. For this study, we pre-process 360 million trajectories for more than 2 million devices from the Greater Paris as our case study region. The model combines mobile network geolocation with transport network geospatial data, travel survey, census and travel card data. The transport modes of mobile network trajectories are identified through a two-steps semi-supervised learning algorithm. The later involves clustering of mobile network areas and Bayesian inference to generate transport probabilities for trajectories. After attributing the mode with highest probability to each trajectory, we construct Origin-Destination matrices by transport mode. Flows are up-scaled to the total population using state-of-the-art expansion factors. The model generates time variant road and rail passenger flows for the complete region. From our results, we observe different mobility patterns for road and rail modes and between Paris and its suburbs. The resulting transport flows are extensively validated against the travel survey and the travel card data for different spatial scales.}

abstract = {Knowledge of trip travel times serves an important role in transportation management and control. Existing travel time estimation approaches generally cover empirical ones, statistical ones and hybrid ones. Despite strong tractability, the empirical approaches cannot sufficiently capture diverse travel time distributions (TTDs) and often encounter some issues (e.g., assumption of a predefined distribution, failure of significance tests). Statistical and hybrid methods possess better generalization in estimating heterogeneous TTDs, but fail to model the network-wide spatiotemporal correlations, which have been found useful in the TTD estimation. To address these drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep learning based Trip Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (T-InfoGAN). In this method, the trip TTD is estimated by modeling the joint distribution of travel times of two successive links with the consideration of network-wide spatiotemporal correlations. Meanwhile, a dynamic clustering with Wasserstein distance (DCWD) algorithm is used to explore the traffic state transitions for link pairs and cluster the link pairs with similar TTDs into one group, which benefits the training and estimation processes of T-InfoGAN. Then, based on GPS trajectory data from Didi Chuxing in Chengdu city, China, numerical results show that the T-InfoGAN with DCWD can well estimate three mini trip TTDs with various features, and performs better than three other counterparts (i.e., Convolution method, MC-Grid method, and MC-GMMS method) in estimating the TTDs of two longer trips. In summary, this study is the first successful try to estimate trip TTDs within the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and the deep learning based T-InfoGAN is a promising approach to estimate heterogeneous trip TTDs with the better generalization and flexibility in the big data era.}

Second, the proposed model strikes a delicate balance between model complexity and accuracy. In contrast to the existing models that view a sensor network as a weighted graph and use graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) to model spatial dependency, we represent a sensor network as an image and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the prediction model. The image is generated by the correlation coefficient between the flow series of sensors, which is different from other CNN based prediction approaches that convert the transportation network into an image by the spatial location of sensors or regions. Compared with the GCNN based model, the CNN based DeepTrend 2.0 can achieve much faster convergence during training, and it guarantees similar prediction quality. Test results indicate that the proposed light-weighted model is efficient and easy to transfer and deploy.}

abstract = {Bridges are critical components of highways ensuring traffic can efficiently travel over obstructions such as bodies of water, valleys, and other roads. Ensuring bridges are in sound structural condition is essential for safe and efficient highway operations. Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems designed to measure bridge responses have been developed to quantitatively track the health of bridges. More recently, SHM systems have also begun to integrate measurement of vehicular loads that create the responses measured. However, precise correlation of traffic loads to bridge responses remains a costly and technically difficult strategy. To address existing technical limitations, a cyber-physical system (CPS) framework is proposed to track truck loads in a highway corridor, to trigger SHM systems to record bridge responses, and to automate the linking of bridge response data with truck weights collected by weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations installed along the corridor but not collocated with the bridges. To link truck weights to bridge responses, computer vision methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to automate the detection and reidentification of trucks using traffic cameras. The single-stage CNN object detector YOLO is trained using a customized dataset to identify trucks from camera images at each instrumentation site; high precision is obtained with the YOLO detector exceeding 95% average precision (AP) for an intersection over union (IOU) threshold of 0.75. To reidentify the same truck at different locations in the corridor, this study adopts a CNN-based encoder trained via a triplet network and a mutual nearest neighbor strategy using feature vectors extracted from images at each measurement location. The proposed reidentification method is implemented in the CPS cloud environment and obtains a F1-score of 0.97. The study also explores the triggering of bridge monitoring systems based on visual detection of trucks by a traffic camera installed upstream to the bridges. The triggering strategy proves to be highly efficient with 99% of the triggered data collection cycles capturing truck events at each bridge. To validate, the CPS architecture is implemented on a 20-mile highway corridor that has a WIM station already installed; four traffic cameras and two bridge SHM systems are installed along the corridor and integrated with a CPS architecture hosted on the cloud.

abstract = {We describe and validate a novel data-driven approach to the real time detection and classification of traffic anomalies based on the identification of atypical fluctuations in the relationship between density and flow. For aggregated data under stationary conditions, flow and density are related by the fundamental diagram. However, high resolution data obtained from modern sensor networks is generally non-stationary and disaggregated. Such data consequently show significant statistical fluctuations. These fluctuations are best described using a bivariate probability distribution in the density–flow plane. By applying kernel density estimation to high-volume data from the UK National Traffic Information Service (NTIS), we empirically construct these distributions for London’s M25 motorway. Curves in the density–flow plane are then constructed, analogous to quantiles of univariate distributions. These curves quantitatively separate atypical fluctuations from typical traffic states. Although the algorithm identifies anomalies in general rather than specific events, we find that fluctuations outside the 95% probability curve correlate strongly with the spikes in travel time associated with significant congestion events. Moreover, the size of an excursion from the typical region provides a simple, real-time measure of the severity of detected anomalies. We validate the algorithm by benchmarking its ability to identify labelled events in historical NTIS data against some commonly used methods from the literature. Detection rate, time-to-detect and false alarm rate are used as metrics and found to be generally comparable except in situations when the speed distribution is bi-modal. In such situations, the new algorithm achieves a much lower false alarm rate without suffering significant degradation on the other metrics. This method has the additional advantages of being self-calibrating and adaptive: the curve marking atypical behaviour is different for each section of road and can evolve in time as the data changes, for example, due to long-term roadworks.}

abstract = {An important aspect of Intelligent Public Transportation Systems (IPTS) is providing accurate travel time information. Knowing arrival times of public vehicles in advance can reduce waiting times of passengers and attract more people to take public transport. Existing approaches have two main limitations in the field of bus travel time prediction. First, influenced by increasingly complex real-time traffic factors and sparsity of real-time data, bus travel times can be difficult to predict accurately in modern cities. Second, bus dwelling and transit times are predominantly affected by different factors and hence have different patterns, but little research focuses on how to divide dwelling and transit areas and to build independent models for them. Consequently, we propose a novel segment-based approach to predict bus travel times using a combination of real-time taxi and bus datasets, that can automatically divide bus routes into dwelling and transit segments. Two models are built to predict them separately by incorporating different impact traffic factors. We evaluate our approach using real-world trajectory datasets, collected in Xi’an, China during June 2017. Compared to existing methods, the experimental results reveal that our approach improves the accuracy of bus travel time prediction, especially under abnormal traffic conditions.}

Around logistics hubs such as seaports, truck flows can have a major impact on the surrounding motorways. Hence, their prediction is important to help manage traffic operations. However, The link between short-term dynamics of logistics activities and the generation of truck traffic has not yet been properly explored. This paper aims to develop a model that predicts short-term changes in truck volumes, generated from major container terminals in maritime ports. We develop, test, and demonstrate the model for the port of Rotterdam. Our input data are derived from exchanges of operational logistics messages between terminal operators, carriers and shippers, via the local Port Community System. We propose a feed-forward neural network to predict the next one hour of outbound truck traffic. To extract hidden features from the input data and select a model with appropriate features, we employ an evolutionary algorithm in accordance with the neural network model. Our model predicts outbound truck volumes with high accuracy. We formulate 2 scenarios to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the model. The model predicts lag and non-proportional responses of truck flows to changes in container turnover at terminals. The findings are relevant for traffic management agencies to help improve the efficiency and reliability of transport networks, in particular around major freight hubs.}

These companies employ surge pricing in real time to balance the needs of both drivers and riders. The prediction of surge prices in the next few minutes to hours encapsulates the complex evolution of service fleets and service demand in the short term. Surge pricing, if effectively predicted and disseminated to both drivers and riders, can be used to more efficiently allocate vehicles, save users money and time, and provide profitable insight to drivers, which ultimately helps the efficiency and reliability of transportation networks. This paper explores the spatio-temporal correlations between the urban environment, traffic flow characteristics, and surge multipliers. We propose a general framework for predicting the short-term evolution of surge multipliers in real-time using a log-linear model with L1 regularization, coupled with pattern clustering. This model is able to predict Uber surge multipliers in Pittsburgh up to two hours in advance using data from the previous hour out-performing the overall mean and the historical average in all but 3 of the 49 locations in Pittsburgh and outperforming three non-linear methods in 28 of the 49 locations. The model is able to out-perform the overall mean, historical mean, and non-linear methods on Lyft surge multipliers in Pittsburgh up to 20 min in advance.

Pedestrians are deemed to be the most vulnerable road users and are the major sufferers of road-incident fatalities and injuries each year. Therefore, quite a few studies have focused on pedestrian’s support and safety. On the other hand, due to imperceptible behavior, a pedestrian may also negatively impact traffic efficiency and can thus be viewed as an obstacle for fully realizing the advantages of ITS. In addition, more issues related to pedestrians have been raised with the emergence of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we discuss different issues related to pedestrians as road users. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive survey and classification of the different solutions of pedestrian protection.

By assessing requirements and opportunities, the controller aims to limit consecutive delays resulting from trains that entered a control area behind schedule by sequencing them at a critical location in a timely manner, thus representing the practical requirements of railway operations. This approach depends on an approximation to the value function of dynamic programming after optimisation from a specified state, which is estimated dynamically from operational experience using reinforcement learning techniques. By using this approximation, the ADP avoids extensive explicit evaluation of performance and so reduces the computational burden substantially. In this investigation, we explore formulations of the approximation function and variants of the learning techniques used to estimate it. Evaluation of the ADP methods in a stochastic simulation environment shows considerable improvements in consecutive delays by comparison with the current industry practice of First-Come-First-Served sequencing. We also found that estimates of parameters of the approximate value function are similar across a range of test scenarios with different mean train entry delays.}

A novel data-based method is presented for designing a Personalized Adaptive Cruise Control (PACC) system in this paper. First, a driving-data-acquisition platform is established, and a large amount of real-world driving data from 84 human drivers is collected. To measure the similarity of human drivers quantitatively, the driving data of every driver are regarded as a specific distribution of some features, fitted with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced as the driving similarity index. After that, an unsupervised clustering algorithm is realized in this paper, and these drivers are grouped into three separate groups. A practical PACC structure is designed in the second stage based on the grouped driving data to include different driving characteristics, mainly in three aspects: speed control, distance control, and the switching rule. Then real-vehicle experiments are carried out. Results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed PACC algorithm to reflect different driving styles.}

It contains two aspects: dynamic rebalancing within each station and static rebalancing among stations. Firstly, we give a new flow-type task window (F-window) by defining the consistency index of travelers. It is more suitable as a task window for rebalancing than time-type task window (T-window) based on three aspects analysis. Through three assumptions, the temporal-distribution learning model including task window and station storage configuration, are built to realize new dynamic rebalancing. The spatial-distribution learning method is introduced to divide management areas for static rebalancing. The empirical results show that F-window can better match the strong time-sensitive of demand fluctuation. Compared with traditional rebalancing needs hours, each rebalancing within a station can be completed within average 4 min. By setting the station storage configuration, it makes rebalancing in this paper meets the demand of 28.3 times the hourly rebalancing within one week. And the number of vehicles visiting stations has dropped below 20%.}

This paper develops a short-term traffic states forecasting algorithm based on partial least square (PLS) to help enhance real-time decision-making and build better insights into traffic data. The proposed model is capable of predicting short-term traffic states accurately and efficiently by capturing dominant spatiotemporal features and day-to-day variations from collinear and correlated traffic data. Three case studies are developed to demonstrate the proposed model in short-term traffic prediction applications.}

This paper investigates the contribution levels of 13 features of human driver's decision-making at USI using a random forest approach. Thirty skilled driver participants are tested in a real-time driving simulator where the traffic scenarios with merging vehicles were designed in different motion styles to mimic real traffic. The experiment results indicate that the relative distance and velocity between merging vehicles have a wider contribution range (i.e., −0.4 −0.4) than the absolute velocity and distance features (i.e., −0.2 −0.2) to predict driver behavior. The contribution also varies over the selected feature values and driving conditions. This contribution research gains insight in the influence of different variables on driver behavior prediction at USI, thereby assisting researchers in selecting representative features in self-driving applications.}

Introducing Short-term Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (STAM) measures such as minor ground delays or slight speed adjustments applied to a selected number of flights on the day of operations, supports the dDCB process by reducing the traffic complexity and the probability of Air Traffic Controllers interventions. This paper introduces a rolling horizon methodology for detecting concurrence events, analysing their trajectory interdependencies and applying a strategic mitigation measure that shifts the Estimated Take-Off Time (ETOT) within the assigned Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT) window. The methodology proposes a collaborative decision-making process for a better coordination of departures from airports feeding airspace volumes with high air traffic demand. The experimental part of this paper aims at showing the potential benefits of such a STAM procedure by applying the methodology to distribute the demand of a sector located in the London Terminal Manoeuvring Area (LTMA). Experiments have considered regulated traffic scenarios where ETOT were allocated in order to reduce departure time uncertainties. Lastly, it is analysed the impact of the parameters used by the methodology to calculate the mitigation measures: safe separation criteria, look-ahead time and number of coordinated airports.}

The method is based on a nonlinear state-space system derived from aircraft point-mass performance models. Using only aircraft surveillance data, flight states such as position, velocity, wind speed, and air temperature are collected and used for the estimations. With the regularized Sample Importance Re-sampling particle filter, we are able to estimate the aircraft mass within 30 seconds once an aircraft is airborne. Using this short flight segment allows the assumption of constant mass and thrust setting. The segment at the start of the climb also represents the time when maximum thrust setting is most likely to occur. This study emphasizes an important aspect of the estimation problem, the observation noise modeling. Four observation noise models are proposed, which are all based on the native navigation accuracy parameters that have been obtained automatically from the surveillance data. Simulations and experiments are conducted to test the theoretical model. The results show that the particle filter is able to quantify uncertainties, as well as determine the noise limit for an accurate estimation. The method of this study is tested with a data-set consisting of 50 Cessna Citation II flights where true masses were recorded.}

Since their primary purposes are often non-transportation related, passively-generated data need to be processed to extract trips. Most existing trip extraction methods rely on data that are generated via a single positioning technology such as GPS or triangulation through cellular towers (thereby called single-sourced data). Methods to extract trips from data generated via multiple positioning technologies (called “multi-sourced data”) are absent. And yet, multi-sourced data are increasingly common. Generated using multiple technologies (e.g., GPS, cellular network- and WiFi-based), multi-sourced data contain high variances in their temporal and spatial properties. In this study, we propose a “Divide, Conquer and Integrate” (DCI) framework to extract trips from multi-sourced data. We evaluate the proposed framework by applying it to an app-based data, which is multi-sourced and has high variances in both location accuracy and observation interval (i.e. time interval between two consecutive observations). On a manually labeled sample of the app-based data, the framework outperforms the state-of-the-art SVM model that is designed for GPS data. The effectiveness of the framework is also illustrated by consistent mobility patterns obtained from the app-based data and an externally collected household travel survey data for the same region and the same period.}

In this paper, from the graph aspects, we construct the dynamic OD graphs to describe the ride-hailing demand data. We propose a novel neural architecture named the Dynamic Node-Edge Attention Network (DNEAT) to address the unique challenges of OD demand prediction from the demand generation and attraction perspectives. Different from previous studies, in DNEAT, we develop a new neural layer, named k-hop temporal node-edge attention layer (k-TNEAT), to capture the temporal evolution of node topologies in dynamic OD graphs instead of the pre-defined relationships among regions. We evaluate our model on two real-world ride-hailing demand datasets (from Chengdu, China, and New York City). The experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms six baseline models and is more robust to demand data with high sparsity.}

Second, we question whether electric cars in general increase drivers’ perceived efficiency of them. Combining these two perspectives, we show that the greater the drivers’ overall perceived satisfaction with LDEVs is, the higher is the drivers’ perceived efficiency of LDEVs. We prove this by means of perceived usefulness (perceived relative advantage) and perceived ease of use (the opposite of perceived complexity) of LDEVs, using adaptations of Davis’ Technology Acceptance Model and Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations Theory to form our Unified Technology Acceptance Model (UTAM). Our findings suggest that, on average, drivers are slightly more satisfied with the LDEVs than with the available conventional cars (n = 66). If drivers were able to choose their preferred vehicles, the majority of them would favor LDEVs. We detect statistically significant patterns of latent measures affecting perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of LDEVs. Although this paper focuses on German delivery service employees, the methodology presented here could easily be applied to any other enterprise in the growing logistics segment which plans to electrify its car fleet. Hence, our contributions are valuable for transportation research and, more specifically, to all potential commercial EV drivers, e.g., our insights might be relevant for the approx. 500,400 drivers employed in the German logistics sector alone.}

abstract = {In the future, autonomous vehicles are expected to safely move people and cargo around. However, as of now, automated entities do not necessarily outperform human drivers under all circumstances, particularly under certain road and environmental factors such as bright light, heavy rain, poor quality of road and traffic signs, etc. Therefore, in certain conditions it is safer for the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. However, switching control back and forth between the human driver and the automated driving entity may itself pose a short-term, elevated risk, particularly because of the out of the loop (OOTL) issue for humans. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework to determine the optimal driving-entity switching policy between the automated driving entity and the human driver. Specifically, we develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model to prescribe the entity in charge to minimize the expected safety cost of a trip, considering the dynamic changes of the road/environment during the trip. In addition, we develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model to accommodate the fact that the risk posed by the immediate road/environment may only be partially observed. We conduct extensive numerical experiments and thorough sensitivity and robustness analyses, where we also compare the expected safety cost of trips under the optimal and single driving entity policies. In addition, we quantify the risks associated with the policies, as well as the impact of miss-estimating road/environment condition risk level by the driving entities, and provide insights. The proposed frameworks can be used as a policy tool to identify factors that can render a region suitable for level four autonomy.}

In the proposed model, the feature engineering focuses on the application scenario of the multi-modal transportation recommendation, and is designed from multiple perspectives of users, travel modes, locations, and time. To learn a better representation of the co-occurrence, we construct a bipartite graph for the Origin-Destination (OD) pair and the User-OD pair of all the query records then transformed nodes in the bipartite graph to feature vectors using a graph-embedding technique. Finally, we propose a post-processing technique to handle the inconsistency between the objective function and evaluation metric. Experimental results from a city-wide multi-modal transportation recommendation indicate that our proposed model is superior to the existing method of navigation service providers.}

Part of the problem relates to the difficulty in collecting comprehensive and reliable information early enough to prepare mitigation measures. A tool that automatically scans the internet for events and predicts their impact would strongly support transport management in many cities in the world. This study addresses the challenges related to retrieving and analyzing web documents about real world events, and using them for demand explanation (if related to a past event) and prediction (if a future one). Transport demand is predicted with a supervised topic modeling algorithm by utilizing information about social events retrieved using various strategies, which made use of search aggregation, natural language processing, and query expansion. It was found that a two-step process produced the highest accuracy for transport demand prediction, where different (but related) queries are used to retrieve an initial set of documents, and then, based on these documents, a final query is constructed that obtains the set of predictive documents. These are then used to model the most discriminating topics related to the transport demand. A framework was proposed that sequentially handles all stages of data gathering, enrichment, and prediction with the intention of generating automated search queries.}

Service providers using such a model can offer a better user experience due to shorter response times, while they also benefit from the increased profits made possible by the global optimization of assignments. This study compares two immediate response strategies (IRSs) in terms of their system performance and individual ability to correctly predict customers’ pickup time windows. It also compares the key performance indicators (KPIs) of global reassignment optimization without immediate responses and several constrained cases in which customer acceptances and rejections are handled by IRSs. Ten combinations of IRSs and service model variations are tested in simulations using the ODM demand data from New York City taxis obtained over one week for varying fleet sizes of between 1,000 and 6,000 vehicles. The results show that in general, the list-based assignments (LBA) approach outperforms the nearest neighbor policy (NNP) as an IRS in most of the scenarios evaluated with respect to KPIs, such as requests served and profit generated for the service provider, while it also produces more empty vehicle mileage and longer customer waiting times. The pickup time window predictions of both LBA and NNP were correct in 68% to 72% of cases in scenarios in which no constraints are induced by the IRS. It was also found that global (re)optimization of assignments helps to improve the profit generated for the service provider, especially if the decision as to which requests are accepted is made during global optimization rather by the IRS. However, such a service model would imply an average customer response time of half the optimization period, which was set to 30s in this study compared to the immediate responses given when using an IRS.}

This paper proposes an adaptive traffic signal control system in a CV environment. At the intersection level, an adaptive control model is developed to assign optimal green times by minimizing the total vehicle delay. When the CV penetration rate is low, a method depending on limited CV data is presented to estimate the vehicle arrival information. At the corridor level, a real-time optimization model is formulated to design the dynamic progression plan for critical paths (i.e. paths with high flows). These two optimization models are solved by the dynamic programming technique. A real-world arterial is modeled in VISSIM to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed traffic signal control system. Simulations with various CV penetration rates and demand levels are conducted to compare the proposed system with fixed coordination and adaptive signal control systems. Results indicate that the proposed system outperforms both base systems by reducing 15.67% and 13.81% of the average delay, respectively, when the CV penetration rate is relatively high. Moreover, the proposed system can improve the arterial performance under all tested scenarios with various CV penetration rates and demand levels. Since the tested demand scenarios can reflect the real traffic fluctuations, it can be proved that the proposed control system could be applied in the field to boost the overall traffic efficiency along the arterial.}

The surrogate model is further enhanced by the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and adaptive sampling to reduce approximation error and improve computational efficiency. To solve the proposed surrogate-based DUE problem on reduced networks, we develop a customized algorithm that integrates the kernel trick with the generalized projection framework. A pre-computation scheme is proposed, which calculates and stores the of kernel matrices and vectors, could further reduce the computational burden.

abstract = {Classification of congestion patterns is important in many areas in traffic planning and management, ranging from policy appraisal, database design, to prediction and real-time control. One of the key constraints in applying machine learning techniques for classification is the availability of sufficient data (traffic patterns) with clear and undisputed labels, e.g. traffic pattern X or Y. The challenge is that labelling traffic patterns (e.g. combinations of congested and freely flow areas over time and space) is highly subjective. In our view this means that assessment of how well algorithms label the data should also include a qualitative component that focuses on what the found patterns really mean for traffic flow operations and applications. In this study, we investigate the application of clustering analysis to obtain labels automatically from the data, where we indeed first qualitatively assess how meaningful the found labels are, and subsequently test quantitatively how well the labels separate the resulting feature space. By transforming traffic measurements (speeds) into (colored) images, two different approaches are proposed to extract the features of a large number of traffic patterns for clustering: point-based and area-based. The point-based approach is widely applied in the image processing literature, and explores local interest points in images (i.e. where large changes occur in color intensity); whereas a new area-based approach combines domain knowledge with Watershed segmentation to partition the images into different spatial-temporal segments from which domain specific features, such as wide moving jam patterns, are extracted. The results show that the Watershed segmentation separates the traffic (congestion) patterns into more meaningful and separable classes, comparable to those that have been proposed in the literature. Since there is no ground-truth set of labels, the quantitative assessment tests how well both methods are able to separate the respective feature spaces they construct for the (large) database of traffic patterns. We argue that the more crisp this separation is; the better the labelling has turned out. For this quantitative comparison we train a multinomial classifier that maps unseen patterns to the labels discovered by each of the two labeling approaches. The most important result is that the classifier using the area-based feature vector achieves the highest average levels of confidence in its decisions to classify patterns, implying a highly separable feature vector space. We argue this is good news! Not only does the combination of image processing (Watershed) and domain knowledge (traffic flow characteristics) lead to meaningful labels that can be automatically retrieved from large databases of data; this method also leads to a more efficient separation of the resulting feature space. Our next endeavor is to further refine and use this method to develop a search engine for the (rapidly growing) 200 TB historical database of traffic data hosted by the Dutch National Datawarehouse (NDW).}

This paper is novel in extending the application of BNs to daily activity tours. Results show that BNs can synthesise both activity and trip chain structures accurately. It outperforms a frequentist approach and can cater for infrequently observed activity patterns, and patterns unobserved in small sample data. It can also account for temporal variables like activity duration.}

abstract = {Lane-changing is one of the complex driving tasks that depends on the number of vehicles, objectives, and lanes. A driver often needs to respond to a lane-changing request of a lane-changer, which is a function of their personality traits and the current driving conditions. A connected environment is expected to assist during the lane-changing decision-making process by increasing situational awareness of surrounding traffic through vehicle-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Although the majority of lane-changing decision-making components (e.g., gap acceptance behaviour, lane-changing execution behaviour, and drivers’ response to a heavy vehicle) in a traditional environment (an environment without driving aids) has been frequently investigated, our understanding of drivers’ interactions during the lane-changing decision-making process in a connected environment remains elusive due to the novelty of a connected environment and the scarcity of relevant data. As such, this study examines drivers’ responses to lane-changing requests in a connected environment using the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Seventy-eight participants responded to the lane-changing request of a lane-changer under two randomised driving conditions: baseline (traditional environment without driving aids) and connected environment (with driving aids). A segmentation-based approach is employed to extract drivers’ responses to the lane-changing request and subsequently estimate their response time from trajectory data. Additionally, drivers’ response times are modelled using a random parameter accelerated failure time (AFT) hazard-based duration model. Results reveal that drivers tend to be more cooperative in response to a lane-changing request in the connected environment compared with the baseline condition whereby they tend to accelerate to avoid the lane-changing request. The AFT model suggests that on average drivers’ response times are shorter in the connected environment, implying that drivers respond to the lane-changing request faster in the presence of driving aids. However, at the individual level, connected environment’s impact on drivers’ response times is mixed as drivers’ response times may increase or decrease in the connected environment compared to the baseline condition, for instance, we find that female drivers have lower response times in the connected environment than that of male drivers. Overall, this study finds that drivers in connected environment, on average, take less time to respond and appear to be more cooperative, and thus, are less likely to be engaged in safety–critical events.}

It has been suggested that if drivers comply with suggested recommendations, connected vehicle technology can introduce huge benefits. However, whether drivers will accept suggestions and what factors will influence their likelihood of accepting the suggestions in a connected environment have not been studied. In addition, few models have been developed to predict drivers’ reactions under such conditions. This paper aims to fill the research gap by examining and modeling drivers’ acceptance and behavior when receiving energy- and safety-related speed recommendations through vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. A mixed-subject-design experiment was conducted in a closed-loop test track, Mcity, with seven intersection maneuver scenarios. A generally high compliance rate to the recommended speed strategies was observed that during 72% of the events, drivers changed their intersection-approaching behavior to follow the recommendations. Mixed models were conducted to explore the impacting factors while Principal Component Analysis was used to classify subjective (i.e., self-reported) data into four categories. To predict drivers’ reactions when offered a speed suggestion, Random Forests were built with 13 independent variables, derived from four categories: vehicle kinematic features, device information, driver characteristics, and subjective data. Using this model, drivers’ reactions during each intersection maneuver could be predicted with a reasonably high accuracy about 87.4 m away from the intersection, where the vehicle started to receive signal phase and timing information. Findings in this study can contribute to the optimization of energy-saving algorithms and the improvement of driving safety by using connected vehicle technologies.}

By processing many-day raw trajectories, we observe a set of historical choices of location-duration-path and identify missing observations in space and time dimensions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply data-driven network-time prisms that reduce the search space for the missing choices. Then, we formulate Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) models with likelihood bounds, a special case of data-driven optimization models using phi-divergences (i.e., χ2 distance), to reconstruct the missing choices. To solve the minimax programs of the DRO models while maintaining tractability, we reformulate and solve the equivalent dual problems of the DRO models based on the strong duality theory. To demonstrate and validate the proposed models, we use a real-world connected vehicle dataset containing around 2,800 connected vehicles over two separate months in Southeast Michigan from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) project and a transportation network from OpenStreetMap.}

Different from other short-term traffic forecasting methods, the short-term OD flow prediction possesses three unique characteristics: (1) data availability: real-time OD flow is not available during the prediction; (2) data dimensionality: the dimension of the OD flow is much higher than the cardinality of transportation networks; (3) data sparsity: URT OD flow is spatiotemporally sparse. There is a great need to develop novel OD flow forecasting method that explicitly considers the unique characteristics of the URT system. To this end, a channel-wise attentive split–convolutional neural network (CAS-CNN) is proposed. The proposed model consists of many novel components such as the channel-wise attention mechanism and split CNN. In particular, an inflow/outflow-gated mechanism is innovatively introduced to address the data availability issue. We further originally propose a masked loss function to solve the data dimensionality and data sparsity issues. The model interpretability is also discussed in detail. The CAS–CNN model is tested on two large-scale real-world datasets from Beijing Subway, and it outperforms the rest of benchmarking methods.

More specifically, the kriging metamodel is adopted to surrogate the optimization function of the calibration process. With this meta-modeling approach, a sound solution can be achieved with only a few sampling points in a comfortably afforded computation burden, thus giving a valid estimation of the parameters in the day-to-day dynamics model.

We review the methods and models to estimate traffic flow states and optimize traffic signal timing plans based on CAVs. We summarize six types of CAV-based traffic control methods and propose a conceptual mathematical framework that can be specified to each of six three types of methods by selecting different state variables, control inputs, and environment inputs. The benefits and drawbacks of various CAV-based control methods are explained, and future research directions are discussed. We hope that this review could provide readers with a helpful roadmap for future research on CAV-based urban traffic control and draw their attention to the most challenging problems in this important and promising field.}

abstract = {Burst passenger flow in the public transportation system is serious to public safety. Existing works mainly focused on prediction and monitoring of regular passenger flow, which are not suitable for burst passenger flow. In this article, we first formulate the problem as early warning of burst passenger flow. Next, we design a novel framework to solve this problem by our observation that a burst passenger in-flow usually comes after an abnormal passenger out-flow for a subway station, especially when there is a large-scale social crowd event. Our framework consists of two models: (1) Abnormal out-flow detection (AOFD) which detects abnormal out-flows and warns the city administration of the burst in-flow fairly ahead of time. (2) Burst in-flow peak estimation (BIFPE) which estimates burst in-flow peak time and volume. We evaluate our framework with real-world smartcard data of the largest city in China and use large-scale social crowd event data to further explain our model. The result shows that: (1) AOFD can detect abnormal out-flows that would later result in bursts in-flows with better performance and can send warning signal ahead of the time of burst passenger in-flow. (2) BIFPE can effectively estimate the peak time of burst in-flow and can reduce peak volume estimation error compared with the traditional passenger flow prediction models.}

Reducing the burden placed on users enables researchers to collect data over longer periods, thus improving the quality of travel behavior research. To reduce battery use the smartphone-based application collects GPS data less frequently than other methods. Therefore, new algorithms were developed to identify trips and activities, transport mode, and even the specific vehicle used by the traveler. An important finding was the significant advantage of using users’ past data to improve mode detection results. The system was tested successfully in Zürich and Basel (Switzerland).}

abstract = {GPS based campaigns have been hailed as an alternative to transportation surveys that promise relatively high accuracy at a relatively low burden on the participants and fewer forgotten trips. However they still necessitate the recruitment of participants and are thus potentially biased and certainly not encompassing significant parts of the population. Given the high penetration of mobile phones, passive tracking by telephone providers would alleviate those two shortcomings at the cost of reduced sampling frequency and positional accuracy. The trade-off in quality has not yet been quantified and therefore recommendations on sensible thresholds are not yet available. In this study therefore, instead of presenting yet another method for mode of transport classification, we therefore compare the performance of existing mode detection schemes under deteriorating sampling rates and positional accuracies. As a possibility to compensate for the deteriorating signal we also calculate features from users’ positional histories that could be beneficial if their behaviour is repetitive. The evaluation is not only based on pointwise accuracy, but includes quality measures that pertain to trips as a whole. We find that the necessary accuracy and sampling rate for applications will depend on whether the information of whole trajectories can be used, or whether only the current information is available. The former being relevant to ex-post analyses while the latter situation appears more frequently in near-time analyses. For segmentwise classification, there is no major impact on the quality of the classification by the tested levels of spatial accuracies as long as the sampling intervals can be kept at or below a minute, whereas for point based classification the sampling interval should be between 30 s and a minute and increasing spatial accuracy always improves the classification.}

This work proposes a probabilistic topic model, adapted from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to discover representative and interpretable activity categorization from individual-level spatiotemporal data in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the activity-travel episodes of an individual user are treated as words in a document, and each topic is a distribution over space and time that corresponds to certain type of activity. The model accounts for a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes—the location, start time of day, start day of week, and duration of each activity episode. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using pseudonymized transit smart card data from London, U.K. The results show that the model can successfully distinguish the three most basic types of activities—home, work, and other. As the specified number of activity categories increases, more specific subpatterns for home and work emerge, and both the goodness of fit and predictive performance for travel behavior improve. This work makes it possible to enrich human mobility data with representative and interpretable activity patterns without relying on predefined activity categories or heuristic rules.}

Big GPS trajectory data analytics offers new opportunities for gaining insights into vehicle movement dynamics and road network usage patterns that are important for transportation studies and urban planning among other fields. Processing big GPS trajectory data, consisting of billions of GPS waypoints and millions of individual trajectories is a challenging yet important task for researchers from these different domains. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark-based geo-computing framework for using big GPS trajectory data to estimate vehicle miles travelled, an important metric used by both federal and state highway agencies in the United States for transportation planning. The computing challenge lies in scaling the processing of billions of raw GPS points data as well as the steps for map matching for a statewide road network consisting of thousands of road segments. In this work, we develop a scalable map-matching module that considers both the spatiotemporal information of GPS waypoint sequences and topologic information of road network for the State of Maryland while striking a balance between matching accuracy and computing time. We processed 19.8 million raw GPS trips consisting of approximately 1.4 billion GPS waypoints collected in Maryland during a four-month period in 2015 to estimate vehicle miles travelled for Maryland’s road network. The estimation results show that using big GPS trajectory analytic methods is promising for obtaining accurate and stable vehicle miles travelled estimates.}

We discuss the psychological factors underlying the question of how safe AVs need to be to compel consumers away from relying on the abilities of human drivers. For consumers, how safe is safe enough? Three preregistered studies (N = 4566) reveal that the established psychological biases of algorithm aversion and the better-than-average effect leave consumers averse to adopting AVs unless the cars meet extremely potentially unrealistically high safety standards. Moreover, these biases prove stubbornly hard to overcome, and risk substantially delaying the adoption of life-saving autonomous driving technology. We end by proposing that, from a psychological perspective, the emphasis AV advocates have put on safety may be misplaced.}

abstract = {Whereas deep neural network (DNN) is increasingly applied to choice analysis, it is challenging to reconcile domain-specific behavioral knowledge with generic-purpose DNN, to improve DNN’s interpretability and predictive power, and to identify effective regularization methods for specific tasks. To address these challenges, this study demonstrates the use of behavioral knowledge for designing a particular DNN architecture with alternative-specific utility functions (ASU-DNN) and thereby improving both the predictive power and interpretability. Unlike a fully connected DNN (F-DNN), which computes the utility value of an alternative k by using the attributes of all the alternatives, ASU-DNN computes it by using only k’s own attributes. Theoretically, ASU-DNN can substantially reduce the estimation error of F-DNN because of its lighter architecture and sparser connectivity, although the constraint of alternative-specific utility can cause ASU-DNN to exhibit a larger approximation error. Empirically, ASU-DNN has 2–3% higher prediction accuracy than F-DNN over the whole hyperparameter space in a private dataset collected in Singapore and a public dataset available in the R mlogit package. The alternative-specific connectivity is associated with the independence of irrelevant alternative (IIA) constraint, which as a domain-knowledge-based regularization method is more effective than the most popular generic-purpose explicit and implicit regularization methods and architectural hyperparameters. ASU-DNN provides a more regular substitution pattern of travel mode choices than F-DNN does, rendering ASU-DNN more interpretable. The comparison between ASU-DNN and F-DNN also aids in testing behavioral knowledge. Our results reveal that individuals are more likely to compute utility by using an alternative’s own attributes, supporting the long-standing practice in choice modeling. Overall, this study demonstrates that behavioral knowledge can guide the architecture design of DNN, function as an effective domain-knowledge-based regularization method, and improve both the interpretability and predictive power of DNN in choice analysis. Future studies can explore the generalizability of ASU-DNN and other possibilities of using utility theory to design DNN architectures.}

Factors influencing takeover performance, such as takeover lead time and the engagement of non-driving-related tasks, have been studied in the past. However, despite the important role emotions play in human-machine interaction and in manual driving, little is known about how emotions influence drivers’ takeover performance. This study, therefore, examined the effects of emotional valence and arousal on drivers’ takeover timeliness and quality in conditionally automated driving. We conducted a driving simulation experiment with 32 participants. Movie clips were played for emotion induction. Participants with different levels of emotional valence and arousal were required to take over control from automated driving, and their takeover time and quality were analyzed. Results indicate that positive valence led to better takeover quality in the form of a smaller maximum resulting acceleration and a smaller maximum resulting jerk. However, high arousal did not yield an advantage in takeover time. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how emotional valence and arousal affect takeover performance. The benefits of positive emotions carry over from manual driving to conditionally automated driving while the benefits of arousal do not.}

With the growing demands for global shipping service, vessel destination prediction has shown its significant role in improving the efficiency of decision making in industry and ensuring a safe and efficient maritime traffic environment. Currently, most vessel destination prediction methods focus on regional destination prediction, which has restrictions on destinations and regions. Thus, this paper proposes a general AIS (Automatic Identification System) data-driven model for vessel destination prediction. In this random forest-based model, the similarity between the vessel’s traveling and historical trajectories are measured and utilized to predict the destination. The destination of the historical trajectory, which shares the highest similarity with the traveling trajectory, is predicted as the vessel’s destination. The method is different from previous work which used maritime records as input to predict the destination. In our method, a historical trajectory database was generated from more than 141 million AIS records, which covers 534,824 traveling patterns between ports and more than 5.9 million historical trajectories. Comparative studies were carried out to validate the performance of the proposed model, where eleven state-of-the-art trajectories similarity measurement methods combined with two different decision strategies were implemented and compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model combined with the port frequency-based decision strategy achieves the best prediction accuracy on 35,937 testing trajectories.}

Indeed, using autonomous public transport vehicles (APTVs) prudently can result in significant improvements in the reliability, efficiency, and attractiveness of PT. The lack of human drivers and the feasible control strategies of the APTVs make it possible to offer a reliable, efficient and attractive service that can handle, in real time, the fluctuations in passenger demand. This work assumes that the APTVs of a single line are controlled centrally and are responsive to real-time requests from passengers. As the result, a real-time schedule can be constructed and communicated to the passengers. However, during the actual operations, the real-time demand will be fluctuated entailing schedule adjustments. These adjustments are optimized in this work using two operational strategies for the APTVs: holding and speed changing. The solution methodology proposed is based on time-space graphical techniques using multi-criteria decision analysis to minimize schedule changes as the primary objective, as well as to reduce travel time and active energy consumption. Two multi-objective models are developed for not-considered and considered vehicle capacity and then examined using a simulation framework. A case study from Auckland, New Zealand, is selected, which assumes that ordinary buses are replaced with APTVs. The results indicate that the strategy-based optimal schedule adjustments achieve a 100% elimination of schedule deviations compared with 33-minute and 13-minute deviations for the low-demand and high-demand scenarios of the ordinary PT service, respectively. The results of the simulated case study indicate that the incorporation of APTVs, along with prudent control, can result in a more attractive PT service.}

However, if the risk of anomaly events is known in advance, appropriate preparation and management can be undertaken to prevent such events and/or alleviate their impacts on road traffic. Therefore, this study attempts to evaluate the risk of standstills based on the degraded road performance estimated from probe vehicle speeds using sequential Bayesian filtering in a state space model (SSM). The SSM comprises a system model constructed by learning historical data and a measurement model using several exogenous variables such as snowfall amounts and temperature. The risk of anomaly events is then determined as the deviation of the filtered vehicle speed by the SSM from the statistically feasible speed distribution. The validation is performed by applying the proposed model to 58 traffic-standstill cases in northern Japan, and we confirm that the model successfully evaluates risks at a reasonable level that permits the practical use.}

Methods or models proposed for describing trip statistics, scaling laws of trips, and dynamics of ridership are reviewed. We summarize four types of factors that influence the spatial-temporal patterns of demands. For the supply part, we focus on the models proposed for describing the spatial-temporal characteristics of available taxis/ride-sharing cars and modeling the behavior of drivers (i.e., passenger-search behavior and route choice behavior) to explain the spatial-temporal patterns of taxi/ride-sharing supplies.

A cell-based map-matching technique is proposed to link vehicle trajectories with road geometries, and to produce network-wide spatio-temporal speed matrices. Data limitations are addressed using the Schatten p-norm matrix completion algorithm, which can minimize speed estimation errors even with high rates of data unavailability. A case study using data from Chengdu, China, demonstrates that the algorithm performs well even in situations involving continuous data loss over a few hours, and consequently, addresses large-scale network-wide traffic state estimation problems with missing data, while at the same time outperforming other data recovery techniques that were used as benchmarks.

Deep learning technologies were recently introduced to traffic forecasting in order to accommodate the spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states. In the present study, we devised a novel graph-based neural network that expanded the existing graph convolutional neural network (GCN). The proposed model allowed us to differentiate the intensity of connecting to neighbor roads, unlike existing GCNs that give equal weight to each neighbor road. A plausible model architecture that mimicked real traffic propagation was established based on the graph convolution. The domain knowledge was efficiently incorporated into a neural network architecture. The present study also employed a generative adversarial framework to ensure that a forecasted traffic state could be as realistic as possible considering the joint probabilistic density of real traffic states. The forecasting performance of the proposed model surpassed that of the original GCN model, and the estimated adjacency matrices revealed the hidden nature of real traffic propagation.}

However, the existing scenario complexity quantification studies mainly have two limitations, namely, subjective quantification methods highly rely on human participations and are difficult to apply to big data, and existing objective methods lack consideration of human driver characteristics and hence the performance cannot be guaranteed. To bridge these research gaps, a general objective quantification framework is proposed to quantify human drivers’ judgement on driving environment complexity, by describing the vehicle-vehicle spatial-temporal interactions from the perspectives of quantity, variety, and relations. The model mainly contains three parts. First, to describe quantity information, a dynamic influencing area was set to identify the surrounding vehicles that contribute to driving environment complexity based on Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) theory. Second, considering the various surrounding vehicles’ driving statuses, behaviors, and intentions, a basic vehicle-pair complexity quantification model was constructed based on encounter angles. Then, nonlinear relationships based upon information entropy theory were introduced to capture the heterogeneous longitudinal and lateral complexities. Third, a vehicle-pair complexity aggregation and smoothing step was conducted to reflect the characteristics of human driver's cognition. To demonstrate the abovementioned model, empirical Field Operational Test (FOT) data from Shanghai urban roadways were used to conduct case studies, and it can be concluded that this model can accurately describe the timing and extent of the complexity change, and reveal the complexity differences due to scenario type and spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Besides, Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) index was calculated to validate the consistency of scenario complexity judgement between the proposed model and human drivers, and for performance comparison with the existing models. Finally, the applications of the proposed model and its further investigations have been discussed.}

Although current research works model and simulate transportation resilience from different perspectives, the real-world resilience of urban road network is still unclear. In this paper, a novel end to end deep learning framework is proposed to estimate and predict the spatiotemporal patterns of transportation resilience under extreme weather events. Diffusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and a dynamic-capturing algorithm of transportation resilience jointly form the backbone of this framework. The presented framework can capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of urban road network and evaluate transportation resilience based on real-world big data, including on-demand ride services data provided by DiDi Chuxing and grid meteorological data. Results show that aggregate data of related precipitation events could be used for transportation resilience modeling under extreme weather events when facing sample imbalance problem due to limited historical disaster data. In terms of observed transportation resilience, transportation network demonstrates different characteristics between sparse network and dense network, as well as general precipitation events and extreme weather events. The response time is double or triple of the recovery time, and an elastic limit exists in the recovery process of network resilience. In terms of resilience prediction, the proposed model outperforms competitors by incorporating topological information and has better predictions of the system performance degradation than other resilience indices. The above results could assist researchers and policy makers clearly understand the real-world resilience of urban road networks in both theory and practice, and take effective responses under emergent disruptive events.}

Indeed, safe, accessible, and sustainable transport systems in cities are a core target of the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Thus, there is an opportunity to apply advanced computational tools to the problem of traffic safety, in regards especially to pedestrians, who have been often overlooked in the past. This paper combines public data sources, large-scale street imagery and computer vision techniques to approach pedestrian and vehicle safety with an automated, relatively simple, and universally-applicable data-processing scheme. The steps involved in this pipeline include the adaptation and training of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network to determine a hazard index for each given urban scene, as well as an interpretability analysis based on image segmentation and class activation mapping on those same images. Combined, the outcome of this computational approach is a fine-grained map of hazard levels across a city, and an heuristic to identify interventions that might simultaneously improve pedestrian and vehicle safety. The proposed framework should be taken as a complement to the work of urban planners and public authorities.}

To understand the recent development and ultimately inspire new research ideas on this important topic, this survey systematically and comprehensively reviews the existing AV-involved traffic flow models with different levels of details, and examines the relationship among the design of AV-based driving strategies, the management of transportation systems, and the resulting traffic dynamics.

Nonetheless, the key components of traffic dynamics, vehicle modeling, and traffic environment are oversimplified in existing simulators. Current traffic simulators normally simplify the function of connected and autonomous vehicles by proposing incremental improvements to the conventional traffic flow modeling methods, which cannot reflect the characteristics of the realistic connected and autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, typical autonomous vehicle simulators only focus on individual function verification in some specific traffic scenarios, omitting the network-level evaluation by integrating both large-scale traffic networks and vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication. This paper designs a comprehensive simulation platform for conventional, connected and automated driving from a transportation cyber–physical system perspective, which tightly combines the core components of V2X communication, traffic networks, and autonomous/conventional vehicle model. Specifically, three popular open-source simulators SUMO, Omnet++, and Webots are integrated and connected via the traffic control interface, and the whole simulation platform will be deployed in a Client/Server model. As the demonstration, two typical applications, traffic flow optimization and vehicle eco-driving, are implemented in the simulation platform. The proposed platform provides an ideal and credible testbed to explore the potential social/economic impact of connected and automated driving from the individual level to the large-scale network level.}

abstract = {Traffic forecasting is a classical task for traffic management and it plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. However, since traffic data are mostly collected by traffic sensors or probe vehicles, sensor failures and the lack of probe vehicles will inevitably result in missing values in the collected raw data for some specific links in the traffic network. Although missing values can be imputed, existing data imputation methods normally need long-term historical traffic state data. As for short-term traffic forecasting, especially under edge computing and online prediction scenarios, traffic forecasting models with the capability of handling missing values are needed. In this study, we consider the traffic network as a graph and define the transition between network-wide traffic states at consecutive time steps as a graph Markov process. In this way, missing traffic states can be inferred step by step and the spatial–temporal relationships among the roadway links can be incorporated. Based on the graph Markov process, we propose a new neural network architecture for spatial–temporal data forecasting, i.e. the graph Markov network (GMN). By incorporating the spectral graph convolution operation, we also propose a spectral graph Markov network (SGMN). The proposed models are compared with baseline models and tested on three real-world traffic state datasets with various missing rates. Experimental results show that the proposed GMN and SGMN can achieve superior prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Besides, the proposed models’ parameters, weights, and predicted results are comprehensively analyzed and visualized.}

Here, any obstacle (neighboring entity on the road) to the subject vehicle is treated as a finite scalar risk field that is formulated in the predicted configuration space of the subject vehicle. The driving risk estimate is the strength of the risk field at the subject vehicle’s future location. This risk field is formulated as the product of two factors: collision probability and expected crash energy. The collision probability with neighboring vehicles is estimated based on probabilistic motion predictions. The risk can be assessed for a single time step or over multiple future time steps, depending on the required temporal resolution of the estimates. We verified the single step approach in three near-crash situations from a naturalistic dataset and in cut-in and hard-braking scenarios with simulation and showed the application of the multi-step approach in selecting the safest path in a lane-drop section. The risk descriptions from the proposed approach qualitatively reflect the narration of the situation and are in general consistent with Time To Collision. Compared to current surrogate measures of safety, the proposed risk estimate provides a better basis to assess the driving safety of an individual vehicle by considering the uncertainty over the future ambient traffic state and magnitude of expected crash consequences. The proposed driving risk model can be used as a component of intelligent vehicle safety applications and as a comprehensive surrogate measure for assessing traffic safety.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel, computational efficient, dynamic ridesharing algorithm. The beneficial computational properties of the algorithm arise from casting the ridesharing problem as a linear assignment problem between fleet vehicles and customer trip requests within a federated optimization architecture. The resulting algorithm is up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art, even if it is implemented on a less dedicated hardware, and achieves similar service quality. Current literature showcases the ability of state-of-the-art ridesharing algorithms to tackle very large fleets and customer requests in almost near real-time, but the benefits of ridesharing seem limited to centralized systems. Our algorithm suggests that this does not need to be the case. The algorithm that we propose is fully distributable among multiple ridesharing companies. By leveraging two datasets, the New York city taxi dataset and the Melbourne Metropolitan Area dataset, we show that with our algorithm, real-time ridesharing offers clear benefits with respect to more traditional taxi fleets in terms of level of service, even if one considers partial adoption of the system. In fact, e.g., the quality of the solutions obtained in the state-of-the-art works that tackle the whole customer set of the New York city taxi dataset is achieved, even if one considers only a proportion of the fleet size and customer requests. This could make real-time urban-scale ridesharing very attractive to small enterprises and city authorities alike. However, in some cases, e.g., in multi-company scenarios where companies have predefined market shares, we show that the number of vehicles needed to achieve a comparable performance to the monopolistic setting increases, and this raises concerns on the possible negative effects of multi-company ridesharing.}

abstract = {By serving two or more passenger requests in each ride in ride-sourcing markets, ride-pooling service is now becoming an important component of shared smart mobility. It is generally expected to improve vehicle utilization rate, and therefore alleviate traffic congestion and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. A few recent theoretical studies are conducted, mainly focusing on the equilibrium analysis of the ride-sourcing markets with ride-pooling services and the impacts of ride-pooling services on transit ridership and traffic congestion. In these studies, there are three key measures that distinguish ride-pooling service analysis from the non-pooling ride-sourcing market analysis. The first is the proportion of passengers who are pool-matched(referred to as pool-matching probability), the second is passengers’ average detour distance, and the third is average vehicle routing distance to pick up and drop off all passengers with different origins and destinations in one specific ride. These three measures are determined by passenger demand for ride-pooling and matching strategies. However, due to the complex nature of ride-resourcing market, it is difficult to analytically determine the relationships between these measures and passenger demand. To fill this research gap, this paper attempts to empirically ascertain these relationships through extensive experiments based on the actual on-demand mobility data obtained from Chengdu, Haikou, and Manhattan. We are surprised to find that the relationships between the three measures (pool-matching probability, passengers’ average detour distance, average vehicle routing distance) and number of passengers in the matching pool (which reflects passenger demand) can be fitted by some simple curves (with fairly high goodness-of-fit) or there exist elegant empirical laws on these relationships. Our findings are insightful and useful to theoretical modeling and applications in ride-resourcing markets, such as evaluation of the impacts of ride-pooling on transit usage and traffic congestion.}

However, previous methods of pedestrian volume collection require either time-consuming ground-truth data collection, or the purchase and maintenance of costly sensors in a large-scale application. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method for large-scale pedestrian estimation at midblock crosswalks using button-pushing and signal timing events. The pedestrian arrival is modeled as a Poisson process, and two submethods are developed to estimate pedestrian volume at one-stage and two-stage button-activated midblock crosswalks (BAMCs). To address the issue of missing signal cycles at two-stage BAMCs, all missing cycles that are identified by using the proposed paired signal cycle identification algorithm are accounted for and added by minimizing the error between estimation results of two stages. Eight days of the ground-truth pedestrian volume is manually collected from two study midblock crosswalks to evaluate the proposed methods. On average, 235 and 230 pedestrians per day were observed to cross the one-stage BAMC and two-stage BAMC, respectively. The average mean absolute error of estimated pedestrian volume using a one-hour interval is 2.27 and 1.78 ped/hour at two study locations, respectively. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed methods are promising for estimating pedestrian volume at midblock crosswalks using event-based data. A further sensitivity analysis of changing the estimation interval shows that the one-hour interval pedestrian volume estimation is recommended as having the least error.}

Next, we apply our trained ANN to classify the respondents from a recent Value-of-Time Stated Choice experiment in terms of their most likely employed decision rule. We cross-validate our findings by comparing our results with those from: (1) single class discrete choice models estimated on subsets of the data, and (2) latent class discrete choice models. The cross-validations provide strong support for the notion that ANNs can be used to identify underlying decision rules in choice data. As such, we believe that ANNs provide a valuable addition to the toolbox of analysts who wish to investigate decision rule heterogeneity. The substantive contribution of this study is that we provide strong empirical evidence for the presence of decision rule heterogeneity amongst travellers.}

Our method follows the procedure of finding feature correspondences from consecutive frames and minimizing its re-projection error. Firstly, we propose an image singular value decomposition algorithm to mitigate the impact of picture blurring. Secondly, a statistic filter of feature space displacement and a circle matching method are proposed to screen or prune potential matched features so as to remove the outliers caused by the mismatching. Thirdly, experiments are conducted on a benchmark dataset KITTI and real outdoor and indoor image data with blur, weak texture or illumination changes to verify the validation of the proposed algorithm. Lastly, the proposed algorithm is successfully applied to indoor parking guidance. The results demonstrate that compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed video-based vehicle ego-positioning scheme has more precise and reliable performance with a lower cost, which provides an appropriate way for indoor parking guidance.}

abstract = {Automated monitoring of pedestrians on non-motorized facilities with high pedestrian flows is challenging. Several automated sensor solutions are commercially available that have been evaluated in the literature including traditional point-based sensors, such as inductive loop detectors for bicycles and infrared sensors for pedestrians. More recently, image-based systems, based on video cameras or thermal video cameras, have been developed. Despite the various options, some key limitations of existing solutions exist, in particular, the lack of low-cost solutions using embedded systems capable of performing in real-time under high volume (flow) conditions. This work aims at developing and evaluating the performance of a novel, real-time counting system, developed for environments with high pedestrian flows. The proposed system is based on emerging LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology. As an input, the system uses the distance measurements from a two-dimensional LiDAR sensor with a set of distinct laser channels and a given angular resolution between each channel. The developed system processes those measurements using a clustering algorithm to detect, count, and identify the direction of travel of each pedestrian. The system’s performance is evaluated by comparing its directional counting outputs with manual counts (ground truth) using disaggregate and aggregate (15-minutes interval) counts at two different monitoring locations. The results demonstrate that the system accurately counts more than 97% of the pedestrians at the disaggregate level, with a false direction detection rate of 1.1%. The over-counting error is 0.7% and the under-counting errors are 1.3% and 2.7% for the two selected sites. At the aggregate level (15-minutes interval), the average absolute percentage deviations (AAPDs) are 1.6% and 4.3% while the weighted AAPDs are 1.5% and 3.5% for the first and second sites, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed system is higher than the traditional technologies used for the same purpose.}

However, RSS’s performance has not yet been tested with real driving data. This study thus calibrates and evaluates the RSS model based on car-following scenarios created from safety-critical events (SCEs) detected in the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. SCEs were identified from the raw data with a trigger method; they were manually validated and then converted into virtual scenarios in which the human-driven subject vehicle was replaced with an AV controlled by a model predictive control based adaptive cruise control (ACC) system embedded with RSS. The RSS model was calibrated with the goal of achieving optimal safety performance, that is, of generating the lowest time-integrated time-to-collision (TIT) after the AV algorithms were implemented in the safety-critical scenarios. By comparing the performance of RSS-embedded ACC, ACC-only, and the unassisted human driver, this study found that: 1) RSS-embedded ACC performed best in eliminating underlying safety-critical situations by controlling the average TIT for each 15-second event at 2.65 s2; 2) RSS-embedded ACC generated the highest average relative speed and relative distance, and the lowest standard deviation of speed; and 3) on average, RSS-embedded ACC was able to perceive the SCEs 2.31 s ahead of the human driver.}

A Virtual LiDAR sensor on the EV perceives the surrounding. Proximity and speed are used to compute longitudinal and lateral components of average relative velocity. A new formulation is presented to compute the effective gap considering all the surrounding obstacles. It is composed of four components: front, rear, left, and right. The former two affect longitudinal acceleration, while the latter two influence lateral acceleration of the EV. A discretionary lane-change model is also developed to account for the driver’s deliberate (not just mandatory) lateral movements. A total of 13 model parameters are used, of which eight are newly introduced. These model parameters are calibrated using 1050 human-driven car trajectories from Next Generation SIMulation dataset. Taguchi’s fractional factorial design principle is used to optimize the parameters. Gray relational analysis indicated that the three newly introduced parameters to be the three most influential parameters. Validation using another 450 car trajectories resulted in a mean radial error of 3.97 m over a horizon of 10 s. The performance measures of two-dimensional motion planning (model error, longitudinal error, and mixed gap error) are found to be better than those reported in the literature. The developed human-like AV-IDM offers a proof of concept.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a double pressure (DP) signal control strategy that takes into account finite link storage capacity. Two types of pressure measures, including an endogenous and an exogenous pressure, are defined. The endogenous pressure is associated with the estimated exit-flow during a signal phase in the next time period, while the exogenous pressure is a virtual pressure associated with the downstream links. The properties of the proposed signal control strategy, including localized waiting time minimization and queue length stabilization at each isolated intersection were discussed. The performance of the proposed signal control strategy was evaluated with two testing networks via simulation, including a network with an isolated signalized intersection and a network with multiple signalized intersections. We compared the performance of the proposed DP control strategy with three existing strategies, including the fixed signal control, adaptive signal control and a back-pressure algorithm based control strategy proposed by previous studies. The test results show promise of the proposed DP control strategy in improving network travel time and queue stability when compared with several state-of-art decentralized control strategies, even though we acknowledge that future efforts in extending the decentralized strategy towards a better system-wide coordination are warranted.}

Recent studies used different classifiers and different inputs for lane change classification and prediction. Here, different methods are used to extract the relevant input variables from a data set which was generated from a naturalistic driving study in the urban area of Chemnitz, Germany. First variables which show different characteristics for left and no lane changes were chosen. The variables contained driver attributes (for instance gazes), environment attributes (for instance distance to other vehicles) and vehicle attributes (for instance velocity). Second, different combinations of these input variables were analyzed with the principal component analysis. In the end, the best combinations were used to classify left lane changes with an Echo State Network and a feedforward neural network. The Echo State Network achieved high area under the curve values, true positive rates and low false positive rates for the classification with a majority of the input combinations. The feedforward neural network predictions were inferior of those to the Echo State Network.}

abstract = {This study proposes an addition to the architecture of the context-aware Driver Assistance Systems (DASs) by introducing a context identification layer to the reasoning subsystem. The proposed layer contains two algorithms that work in sequence: the infrastructure detection algorithm and the driver classification algorithm, respectively. The infrastructure detection algorithm aims to identify intersection-related driving when the driver adjusts his or her behavior due to the presence of an intersection ahead. Then, the driver classification algorithm categorizes drivers into cautious, normal, and aggressive at both locations. Data from 64 drivers in a Naturalistic Driving Study was used to prove the concept of the proposed layer. Several behavioral measures were extracted, including following distance, relative speed, headway, acceleration, time-to-collision, and jerk. These behavioral measures were then used to train the algorithms in the context identification layer. The results of both algorithms supported the concept of the proposed layer. These results have implications related to driver behaviors including i) the intersection-related driving behavior can be detected, ii) the drivers tend to be relatively aggressive at intersections when compared to segments, and iii) the driver classification, which ignores the driver’s relative location to intersections, were more likely to misclassify drivers as aggressive when they were in high intersection density areas such as downtown cores. The findings of this study emphasized the importance of context-aware DAS architecture that acknowledges and integrates the variation in driver behavior due to both a change in the surrounding environment and drivers’ individual needs.}

Through Basic Safety Message (BSM) data from the Michigan Safety Pilot Program, this study applies a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to understand driving behavior in terms of acceleration, deceleration and maintaining speed decisions. Personally Revealed Choices (PRC) that maximize the expected sum of rewards for individual drivers are obtained by analyzing detailed data from 120 trips and the application of MDP. Specifically, this paper defines states based on the number of objects around the host vehicle and the distance to the front object. Given the states, individual drivers’ reward functions are estimated using the multinomial logit model and used in the MDP framework. Optimal policies (i.e. PRC) are obtained through a value iteration algorithm. The results show that as the number of objects increases around a host vehicle, the driver prefer to accelerate in order to escape the crowdedness around them. In addition, when trips are segmented based on the level of crowdedness, increased levels of trip crowdedness results in a fewer number of drivers accelerating because the traffic conditions constrain them to maintaining constant speed or deceleration. One potential application of this study is to generate short-term predictive driver decision information through historical driving performance, which can be used to warn a host vehicle driver when the person substantially deviates from their own historical PRC. This information could also be disseminated to surrounding vehicles as well, enabling them to foresee the states and actions of other drivers and potentially avoid collisions.}

In this paper, we propose a data-driven AID framework that can leverage large-scale historical traffic data along with the inherent topology of the traffic networks to obtain robust traffic patterns. Such traffic patterns can be compared with the real-time traffic data to detect traffic incidents in the road network. Our AID framework consists of two basic steps for traffic pattern estimation. First, we estimate a robust univariate speed threshold using historical traffic information from individual sensors. This step can be parallelized using MapReduce framework thereby making it feasible to implement the framework over large networks. Our study shows that such robust thresholds can improve incident detection performance significantly compared to traditional threshold determination. Second, we leverage the knowledge of the topology of the road network to construct threshold heatmaps and perform image denoising to obtain spatio-temporally denoised thresholds. We used two image denoising techniques, bilateral filtering and total variation for this purpose. Our study shows that overall AID performance can be improved significantly using bilateral filter denoising compared to the noisy thresholds or thresholds obtained using total variation denoising.}

Ubiquitous mobile phones and data generated from the events of these mobile devices provide a promising approach for traffic status detection. This paper proposes a novel approach solely using cellular event data without the cellphone GPS information to detect traffic status on arterial roads. Different from the conventional methods, the proposed approach uses features derived only from cellular data to estimate traffic status, not requiring any cellphone location information. Both handoff (HO) and location update (LU) events generated at each cellular station were extracted from the original data to form a candidate feature set. A feature selection method based on joint mutual information (JMI) was used to select features to cover the maximum information, which can resolve issues such as loss of useful information caused by conventional feature selection techniques. A support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was then employed to model the relationship between the selected features and traffic status (low, medium, and high-traffic). Finally, the proposed method was validated by both a field experiment in Taicang, China with 1-hour-time-interval samples and a simulation experiment on VISSIM with 5-minute-time-interval samples. This study provides a new perspective for traffic status detection which may help design strategies for traffic management and route navigation to improve traveling efficiency, especially for the cities lack of traffic surveillance devices.}

However, the potential of RNN-based models in traffic forecasting has not yet been fully exploited in terms of the predictive power of spatial–temporal data and the capability of handling missing data. In this paper, we focus on RNN-based models and attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate RNN and its variants into traffic prediction models. A stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM network architecture (SBU-LSTM) is proposed to assist the design of neural network structures for traffic state forecasting. As a key component of the architecture, the bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) is exploited to capture the forward and backward temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data. To deal with missing values in spatial–temporal data, we also propose a data imputation mechanism in the LSTM structure (LSTM-I) by designing an imputation unit to infer missing values and assist traffic prediction. The bidirectional version of LSTM-I is incorporated in the SBU-LSTM architecture. Two real-world network-wide traffic state datasets are used to conduct experiments and published to facilitate further traffic prediction research. The prediction performance of multiple types of multi-layer LSTM or BDLSTM models is evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM architecture, especially the two-layer BDLSTM network, can achieve superior performance for the network-wide traffic prediction in both accuracy and robustness. Further, comprehensive comparison results show that the proposed data imputation mechanism in the RNN-based models can achieve outstanding prediction performance when the model’s input data contains different patterns of missing values.}

The purpose of this study is to observe from actual data a clearance boundary, called Safety Space, drivers maintain from other vehicles, and use it as a spatial filter to determine conflicts in mixed traffic flows. Image data are collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and microscopic characteristics such as vehicle type, position, velocity, and trajectory are extracted through computer vision techniques. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier are utilized for the vehicle detection, while the Kalman Filter is employed for the derivation of vehicle trajectories. The Safety Space is then determined based on those trajectories. Validation data are collected at intersections in Taipei, Taiwan; Bangkok, Thailand; and Mumbai, India. The vehicle detection and tracking are satisfactory, and the Safety Space surrogate reveals risk zones caused by spatial proximity between vehicles.}

In doing so, we care about not only the model configuration but also the representation of data (i.e., matrix, third-order tensor and fourth-order tensor). Using a nine-week spatiotemporal traffic speed data set (road segment × day × time of day) collected in Guangzhou, China, we evaluate the performance of this fully Bayesian model and explore how different data representations affect imputation performance through extensive experiments. The results show the proposed model can produce accurate imputations even under temporally correlated data corruption. Our experiments also show that data representation is a crucial factor for model performance, and a third-order tensor structure outperforms the matrix and fourth-order tensor representations in preserving information in our data set. We hope this work could give insights to practitioners when performing spatiotemporal data imputation tasks.}

The framework includes modules of probability fitting, Random Forest, a cluster-based time-domain analysis, and a visualization toolset. A case study is discussed based on the usage data from Mobike, one of the largest operating bike-sharing systems in Shanghai (China). The daily usage dynamics is modeled using log-normal distributions. Random Forest is adopted to explore the impact of factors on the usage frequency in different districts. It is found that residential area, park & green area, and population size are the top three factors influencing the frequency. Particularly, usage near metro stations is delved using the hierarchical clustering method, resulting in three typical usage modes. Visualization analysis is demonstrated to understand the time-varying flow patterns and the spatial distribution of shared bikes. This study improves our understanding of the usage patterns of this emerging transport mode and provides insights for the promotion and dynamic deployment of the bike-sharing system in urban areas.}

Normally, the motion control of the vehicle is composed of trajectory planning and trajectory following according to the surrounding risk factors, the vehicles’ capabilities as well as tyre/road interaction situations. However, pure trajectory following with a unique path may make the motion control of the vehicle be too careful and cautious with a large amount of steering effort. To follow a planned trajectory, the AVs with the traditional path-following control algorithms will correct their states even if the vehicles have only a slight deviation from the desired path or the vehicle detects static infrastructure like roadside trees. In this case, the safety of the AVs can be guaranteed to some degree, but the comfort and sense of hazards for the drivers are ignored, and sometimes the AVs have unusual motion behaviours which may not be acceptable to other road users. To solve this problem, this study aims to develop a safety corridor-based vehicle motion control approach by investigating human-driven vehicle behaviour and the vehicle’s dynamic capabilities. The safety corridor is derived by the manoeuvring action feedback of actual drivers as collected in a driving simulator when presented with surrounding risk elements and enables the AVs to have safe trajectories within it. A corridor-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) has been developed which controls the vehicle state to achieve a smooth and comfortable trajectory while applying trajectory constraints using the safety corridor. The safety corridor and motion controller are assessed using four typical scenarios to show that the vehicle has a human-like or human-oriented behaviour which is expected to be more acceptable for both drivers and other road users.}

The key point to make full use of ACC advantages and make up human’s weakness on supervising task is the reasonable arrangement of control time of ACC and human driver. In this paper, an MPC (Model Predictive Control) based optimized switching strategy of longitudinal driving authority transition is proposed, which aims to provide proper advice for human drivers to handover and takeover control authority, through minimizing the overall index consisted of the operation workload, fuel consumption, takeover risk and tracking errors. In addition, a new driver longitudinal model considering actual reaction time delay and insensitive distance perception of human drivers is proposed as well, which combines with ACC to constitute a typical switched control system called the switched driving model as the predictive model for MPC. The stable condition of the new driver longitudinal model is derived by using describing function method and a sufficient condition to ensure steady switched system is given by using the Lyapunov method and LMI approach. The results of simulator experiments show that the new driver model describes the car-following behavior of real human driver better. What’s more, the simulation results demonstrate that the performance index of switched driving is smaller than the human driving and ACC driving only, and the optimization time is short enough to meet the requirement of engineering practice.}

When the number of attributes describing the agents and/or their level of detail becomes large, survey data cannot densely support the joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of dimensionality. It leads to a situation where many attribute combinations are missing from the sample data while such combinations exist in the real population. In this case, it becomes essential to consider methods that are able to impute such missing information effectively. In this paper, we propose to use deep generative latent models. These models are able to learn a compressed representation of the data space, which when projected back to the original space, leads to an effective way of imputing information in the observed data space. Specifically, we employ the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for a large-scale population synthesis application. The models are applied to a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more than 60 variables and trained and tested using cross-validation. A new metric that applies to the evaluation of generative models in an unsupervised setting is proposed. It is based on the ability to generate diverse yet valid synthetic attribute combinations by comparing if the models can recover missing combinations (sampling zeros) while keeping truly impossible combinations (structural zeros) models at a minimum. For a low-dimensional experiment, the VAE, the marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5%, 21% and 26% more structural zeros per sampling zero when compared to the WGAN. For a high dimensional case, these figures increase to 44%, 2217% and 170440% respectively. This research directly supports the development of agent-based systems and in particular cases where detailed socio-economic or geographical representations are required.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of urbanization and modernization, it is increasingly crucial to sense network-wide traffic. Network-wide traffic volume information is of great benefit for traffic planning, government management and vehicle emissions control. However, it is difficult to install detectors on every intersection due to the expensive deployment and maintenance costs, and the insufficient sensor coverage across the network limits the direct availability of network-wide traffic flow information. Whereas, crowdsourcing floating car data with a high coverage rate are currently available, which creates an opportunity to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to estimate network-wide traffic flow, which incorporates flow records and crowdsourcing floating car data into a geometric matrix completion model. Furthermore, a spatial smoothing index based on the divergence is developed to measure the difficulty of volume estimation for each road segment. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other benchmark models and that the proposed index is highly correlated to estimation accuracy.}

abstract = {With the advent of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), spatiotemporal traffic data has gained growing importance in real-time monitoring, prediction, and control of traffic. However, in practical implementations, data collection devices are often faced with malfunctions caused by various unpredictable disruptions, thereby resulting in the so-called “missing value problems.” In realistic cases, the disruptions to the data collection devices are often associated with some key events (e.g., power cut and natural disasters), in addition, along with other disruptions the missing value problem could be in a complicated manner with both randomly and completely missing patterns. To perform the imputation task with such complicated missing patterns, we propose a hybrid spatiotemporal method which utilizes the time series properties by “prophet” model and captures the spatial residuals information by iterative random forest model. The spatiotemporal method first applies the temporal part to fill the missing value and then adopts the spatial part to acquire the residual component of the missing values. The results of the two components are integrated into the final imputations. Based on the PeMS freeway dataset (PeMS, 2019) and an urban road dataset under extensive artificially designed scenarios like randomly, clustered non-completely and completely missing patterns, we test our proposed approach with some existing techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL), Bayesian tensor decomposition, Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE). The test results indicate that the hybrid method achieves the best imputation quality for most missing patterns, particularly for those with completely or hybrid missing patterns. Furthermore, the hybrid model still performs well under extreme missing rates as high as 0.9, which validates the robustness of the model in extreme situations.}

We found in this study that the Japanese consumers’ WTP is, on average, lower than the estimates for the US market and is not sufficient to enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to capture a meaningful share of the existing car market. Second, compared with a previous study in the US, we propose and discuss an expected social dilemma caused by the ethical problems that AVs will face, known as the Trolley Problems.

First, after a principal component analysis, observation days of a historical dataset are clustered. Two different methods are compared: a Gaussian Mixture Model and a k-means algorithm. The clustering results reveal that congestion maps of days of the same group have substantial similarity in their traffic conditions and dynamic. Such a map is a binary visualization of the congestion propagation on the freeway, giving more importance to the traffic dynamics. Second, a consensus day is identified in each cluster as the most representative day of the community according to the congestion maps. Third, this information obtained from the historical data is used to predict traffic congestion propagation and travel times. Thus, the first measurements of a new day are used to determine which consensual day is the closest to this new day. The past observations recorded for that consensual day are then used to predict future traffic conditions and travel times. This method is tested using ten months of data collected on a French freeway and shows very encouraging results.}

abstract = {The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods, such as autoregressive or spatio-temporal models, is often extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance, particularly by midnight (called ‘next-day morning traffic prediction’ thereafter). In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as a probing method to understand the impacts of people’s work and rest patterns in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic. The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides, people’s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning (by 5am) are statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning commute congestion using people’s tweeting profiles extracted by 5am. In most cases, the tweet information collected by the midnight before is sufficient to make good prediction for next-day morning traffic. The Pittsburgh study supports that this framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion variation, while its prediction performance being no worse than baseline methods on other roads. Through experiments, we demonstrate our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights. The proposed social media empowered framework can be a promising tool for real-time traffic management and potentially extended for traffic prediction at other times of day.}

abstract = {The importance of calibration of microscopic traffic models as the main core of traffic simulation software results from the need for more realistic traffic behaviors. The latent essence of several parameters in such models as well as the uncertainties resulting from the noise in the data, make the process of calibration much more complex. Usually, the calibration process is formulated as an optimization problem. Selecting the appropriate solution algorithm due to nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem is crucial. The importance of the issue is more significant when the matter of calibrating the medium or large-scale simulation model is considered. This is mainly due to the expensive cost that running the simulation models impose. Therefore, applying the current algorithms in which finding the appropriate solutions requires a large number of simulation runs is not deemed suitable. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm based on copula theory has been suggested. In contrast with traditional solution algorithms, in the proposed algorithm complex interaction between parameters of a model has been considered by constructing and sampling from a copula-based probabilistic model. Copulas are functions that describe the dependence structure of a set of random variables and connect multivariate distribution functions to one-dimensional marginal distribution functions. The results indicate that applying an explicit probabilistic model based on copula helps the estimation of distribution algorithm to explore the search space more effectively and efficiently as well as provides the possibility of extracting the knowledge with regard to the structure of the calibration problem through analyzing the probabilistic models that are constructed during the evolution process. Furthermore, this new algorithm has been compared with the genetic algorithm and kernel-based cross-entropy method on synthetic and real trajectory data. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in terms of convergence rate, resource usage and more robust in terms of the probability of finding the global optimal solution.}

While GPS data, typically collected by smartphone apps, are restricted to rather small samples of the population, mobile phone network data, routinely collected by mobile network operators, potentially allow to analyze travel behaviors and social interaction of the whole population, with full temporal (e.g., longitudinal) coverage at a comparatively low cost. Therefore, recent years have seen an increasing interest in using such data for human mobility studies. However, due to their noisy and temporally infrequent/irregular nature, extracting mobility information such as transport modes from these data is particularly challenging. This paper provides an in-depth, systematic review of transport mode detection based on mobile phone network data. The results of the review show that existing studies tend to identify easy-to-detect modes (e.g., train or metro), or aggregate fine-grained modes into more general groups (e.g., public versus private transport). Rule-based methods making use of geographic data were often developed. More importantly, due to the lack of ground truth data, evaluation of the proposed methods was seldom done and reported. Finally, we identify a list of research gaps currently being faced in this field, particularly regarding robust and real-time data cleaning and mode detection methods, “benchmark” datasets and metrics allowing the comparison of different mode detection methods, as well as privacy and bias issues.}

abstract = {The fundamental challenge of the origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation problem is that it is severely under-determined. In this paper we propose a new data driven OD estimation method for cases where a supply pattern in the form of speeds and flows is available. We show that with these input data, we do not require an iterative dynamic network loading procedure that results in an equilibrium assignment, nor do we need an assumption on the kind of equilibrium that emerges from this process. The minimal number of ingredients which are needed are (a) a method to estimate/predict production and attraction time series; (b) a method to compute the N shortest paths from each OD zone to the next; and (c) two—possibly OD-specific—assumptions on the magnitude of N; and on the proportionality of path flows between these origins and destinations, respectively. The latter constitutes the most important behavioral assumption in our method, which relates to how we assume travelers have chosen their routes between OD pairs. We choose a proportionality factor that is inversely proportional to realized travel time, where we incorporate a penalty for path overlap. For large networks, these ingredients may be insufficient to solve the resulting system of equations. We show how additional constraints can be derived directly from the data by using principal component analysis, with which we exploit the fact that temporal patterns of production and attraction are similar across the network. Experimental results on a toy network and a large city network (Santander, Spain) show that our OD estimation method works satisfactorily, given a reasonable choice of N, and the use of so-called 3D supply patterns, which provide a compact representation of the supply dynamics over the entire network. Inclusion of topological information makes the method scalable both in terms of network size and for different topologies. Although we use a neural network to predict production and attraction in our experiments (which implies ground-truth OD data were needed), there are straight-forward paths to improve the method using additional data, such as demographic data, household survey data, social media and or movement traces, which could support estimating such ground-truth baseline production and attraction patterns. The proposed framework would fit very nicely in an online traffic modeling and control framework, and we see many paths to further refine and improve the method.}

As observed demand cannot be higher than available supply, historical transport data typically represents a biased, or censored, version of the true underlying demand pattern. Without explicitly accounting for this inherent distinction, predictive models of demand would necessarily represent a biased version of true demand, thus less effectively predicting the needs of service users. To counter this problem, we propose a general method for censorship-aware demand modeling, for which we derive a censored likelihood function capable of handling time-varying supply. We apply this method to the task of shared mobility demand prediction by incorporating the censored likelihood within a Gaussian Process model, which can flexibly approximate arbitrary functional forms. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show how taking into account the limiting effect of supply on demand is essential in the process of obtaining an unbiased predictive model of user demand behavior.}

In this paper, we propose the Multiple Spatio-Temporal Information Fusion Networks (MSTIF-Net), a novel deep learning approach to better fuse multiple situation awareness information and graphs representation. MSTIF-Net model integrates structures of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Sequence to Sequence Learning (Seq2seq) model to obtain the joint latent representation of urban ride-hailing situation that contain both Euclidean spatial features and non-Euclidean structural features, and capture the spatio-temporal dynamics. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world large scale urban traffic datasets and the experimental studies demonstrate MSTIF-Net has achieved superior performance of urban ride-Hailing demand prediction compared with some traditional state-of-art baseline models.}

Although advances have been made in understanding both the promotion of ADS trust and its impact on NDRT performance, the influence of risk remains largely understudied. To fill this gap, we conducted a within-subjects experiment with 37 licensed drivers using a simulator. Internal risk was manipulated by ADS reliability and external risk by visibility, producing a 2 (ADS reliability) × 2 (visibility) design. The results indicate that high reliability increases ADS trust and further enhances the positive impact of ADS trust on NDRT performance, while low visibility reduces the negative impact of ADS trust on driver monitoring. Results also suggest that trust increases over time if the system is reliable and that visibility did not have a significant impact on ADS trust. These findings are important for the design of intelligent ADSs that can respond to drivers’ trusting behaviors.}

We merge train location and passenger trip data to decompose total journey times into three constituent parts: access times as passengers enter the system, on-train times, and egress times as passengers exit at their destinations. For each journey time component, we estimate non-linear functional relationships which we then use to derive elasticity estimates of journey times with respect to service supply and demand factors, including operational and physical characteristics of metros as well as passenger demand and passenger-specific travel characteristics. We find that the static fixed physical characteristics of stations and routes have the greatest influence on journey time, followed by train speeds, and headways, for which the average elasticities of total journey time are −0.54 and 0.05, respectively. The results of our analysis could inform operators about where potential interventions should be targeted in order to improve journey time performance.}

After estimation, it is common practice to use aggregate measurements to calibrate the estimated model-system’s parameters prior to their application in transportation planning, policy making, and operations. However, calibration of activity-based model-systems has received much less attention. Existing calibration approaches are myopic heuristics in the sense that they do not consider the fundamental inter-dependencies among choice-models and do not have a systematic way to adjust model parameters. Also, other purely simulation-based approaches do not perform well in large-scale applications. In this study, we focus on utility-maximizing nested logit activity-based model-systems and calibrating aggregate statistics such as activity shares, mode shares, time-dependent & mode-specific OD flows, and time-dependent & mode-specific sensor counts. We formulate the calibration problem as a simulation-based optimization problem and propose a stochastic gradient-based solution procedure to solve it. The solution procedure relies on microsimulation to calculate expectations of the aggregate statistics of interest to the calibration problem. Additionally, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the gradient of the objective function —that are evaluated through microsimulation on mini-batches of the population. The proposed solution procedure is sensitive to the fundamental structure of the activity-based model-system and is non-myopic in considering the dependencies across its model components. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, highly nonlinear, and potentially has multiple-minima. Finally, we show —through a real-world application— that the proposed solution procedure outperforms other state-of-the-art purely simulation-based optimization approaches in terms of computational efficiency, stability, and convergence. We also compare various gradient-based solution algorithms to determine the best algorithm to update the parameters. This work has the potential to facilitate wider and easier application of activity-based model-systems.}

abstract = {In an intercontinental container liner service, container shipping operators reserve container slots for the customers who book capacity for their cargoes a few weeks before the ship depart from a particular port. In practice, some of these bookings are finally cancelled without loading any containers onto the ships, which leads to a low loading rate and revenue loss. However, deep analyses of container slot booking cancellation in container liner services rarely appear in the literature due to the lack of real data. The characteristics and patterns of the container slot booking cancellation are unclear from both academic and managerial perspectives. To fill this gap, this study first proposes a conceptual model for the container slot booking cancellation analysis in intercontinental shipping services. A case study on a container liner service between Asia and US west coast is then conducted based on the proposed model. The static and dynamic cancellation rates of voyage, the attributes of bookings, and the factors that may influence the cancellation behaviours are inspected and discussed. The primary findings of this study will benefit both the academic research on container shipping slot bookings and the practices of the slot cancellation control in container shipping company.}

abstract = {The present work proposes a global framework to estimate all MFD model parameters using mobile phone data. The three major components that are estimated in the present context are MFD shapes, regional trip lengths and path flow distribution. A trip enrichment scheme based on the map matching process is proposed for the trips that have sparser records. Time dependent penetration rates are estimated by fusing the OD matrix and the Loop Detector Data (LDD). Two different types of penetration rates of vehicles are proposed based on the OD flow and the trips starting within an origin, respectively. The estimated MFDs based on two types of penetration rates are stable with very low scatter. In the following step, macro-paths and their corresponding trip lengths are estimated. This work is the first to present empirical evidences of the dynamic evolution of mean trip lengths over the day, which is very difficult to capture with other types of data sources. The last component is the time dependent path flow distributions between the different macro-paths for a given OD pair. The manuscript is concluded by presenting the time evolution of the User Equilibrium (UE) gap for different macroscopic OD pairs. It is noticed that UE principle holds true most of the time, except for OD pairs that have macro-paths transversing through congested reservoirs, especially during peak hours.}

However, finding the globally optimal solution of the repair and work zone policy for a large-scale pavement network along a long-term planning horizon can be computationally cumbersome. In this study, as a benchmark, we first propose an exact solution algorithm based on dynamic programming. Then we second propose a computationally feasible methodology, a time-invariant simplified rule, to determine desirable (near-optimal) policies. The proposed methodology is applied to two numerical studies: (i) Case 1 for a small-scale road pavement system to compare life cycle costs and computational times between the rule-based methodology and the exact solution algorithm, and (ii) Case 2 for a real-scale road pavement system to discuss the effectiveness of the rule-based methodology. In Case 1, the rule-based methodology derives a near-optimal solution with a significantly shorter computational time than the exact solution algorithm. Case 2 shows that the rule-based methodology can find a superior policy to the aggregation of the optimal solutions independently found for each of decomposed sub-systems in a feasible computational time. Through sensitivity analyses, we find that the repair and work zone policies should vary depending on the deterioration process, cost factors, and weight between agency and user costs for society’s view or available budget for the agency’s perspective.}

However, the early promises of ridesharing for alleviating congestion in cities may be undermined by a number of challenges, including the growing number of proposed services and the subsequent increasing number of vehicles, as a natural consequence of competition. In this work, we present optimization-based approaches to model cooperation and competition between multiple ridesharing companies, in a real-time on-demand setting. A recent trend relies on solving the integrated combination of Dial-A-Ride Problems (DARP), which compute the cost of assigning incoming requests to vehicle routes, plus Linear Assignment Problems (LAP), which assign vehicles to requests. While the DARPs, are solved at the level of the vehicles of each company, we introduce cooperative and competitive approaches to solve the LAP. The cooperative model, which could make use of Mobility as a Service platforms, is shown to solve the LAP to optimality following closely results from the literature, and limiting the amount of information the companies are required to share. We investigate how a realistic model of competition deviates from this optimality and provide worst case bounds. We evaluate these models with respect to a centralized model on one-week instances of the New York City taxi dataset. Model variants coping with noise in the travel time estimations, bias in the assignment costs, and preferences in the competitive case are also presented and validated. The computational results suggest that cooperation among ridesharing companies can be conducted in such a way to limit the degradation of the level of service with respect to a centralized model. Finally, we argue that the competition can lower the quality of the ridesharing service, especially in the case customer preferences are accommodated.}

Our method shows its benefits in uncovering the potential correlation between varying topologies of trip combinations and specific activity chains. Commuting, different types of transfer, and other travel behaviors have been identified. Besides, varying travel-activity chains like “Home→Work→Post-work activity (for dining or shopping)→Back home” and the corresponding travel motifs have been distinguished by incorporating the land use information in the GIS data. The analysis results contribute to our understanding of transit riders’ travel behavior. We also present application examples of the travel motif to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach.

This variation is especially important from a driver’s perspective: if a platform’s drivers experience systematic disparities in earnings because of variation in their riders’ destinations, they may perceive the pricing model as inequitable. This perception can exacerbate search frictions if it leads drivers to avoid locations where they believe they may be assigned “unlucky” fares. To characterize any such systematic disparities in productivity, we develop an analytic framework with three key components. First, we propose a productivity metric that looks two consecutive trips ahead, thus capturing the effect on expected earnings of market conditions at drivers’ drop-off locations. Second, we develop a natural experiment by analyzing trips with a common origin but varying destinations, thus isolating purely spatial effects on productivity. Third, we apply a spatial denoising method that allows us to work with raw spatial information exhibiting high levels of noise and sparsity, without having to aggregate data into large, low-resolution spatial zones. By applying our framework to data on more than 1.4 million rides in Austin, Texas, we find significant spatial variation in ride-sourcing driver productivity and search frictions. Drivers at the same location experienced disparities in productivity after being dispatched on trips with different destinations, with origin-based surge pricing increasing these earnings disparities. Our results show that trip distance is the dominant factor in driver productivity: short trips yielded lower productivity, even when ending in areas with high demand. These findings suggest that new pricing strategies are required to minimize random disparities in driver earnings.}

Due to the large scale, the trajectory data have become a potential substitute for the widely used fixed-location sensors in terms of the performance measures of transportation networks. Specifically, for traffic volume and queue length estimation, most of the trajectory data based methods in the existing literature either require high market penetration of the probe vehicles to identify the shockwave or require the prior information about the queue length distribution and the penetration rate, which may not be feasible in the real world. To overcome the limitations of the existing methods, this paper proposes a series of novel methods based on probability theory. By exploiting the stopping positions of the probe vehicles in the queues, the proposed methods try to establish and solve a single-variable equation for the penetration rate of the probe vehicles. Once the penetration rate is obtained, it can be used to project the total queue length and the total traffic volume. The validation results using both simulation data and real-world data show that the methods would be accurate enough for assistance in performance measures and traffic signal control at intersections, even when the penetration rate of the probe vehicles is very low.}

In this paper, we show how temporal patterns of vehicle traffic define the performance of urban road networks. We present two high-resolution traffic datasets covering a year each. We introduce a methodology to quantify the similarity of macroscopic traffic patterns. We do so by using the concepts of the MFD and a dynamic time warping (DTW) based algorithm for time series. This allows us to derive a few representative MFD clusters that capture the essential macroscopic traffic patterns. We then provide an in-depth analysis of traffic heterogeneity in the network which is indicative of the previously found clusters. Thereupon, we define a parsimonious classification approach to predict the expected MFD clusters early in the morning with high accuracy.}

This paper investigates, on the one hand, how travel information affects route choice behaviour, and on the other hand, the impact of the travel time representation on the interpretation of parameter estimates and prediction accuracy. To this end, we estimate recursive models using data from an innovative data collection effort consisting of route choice observation data from GPS trackers, travel diaries and link travel times on the overall network. Though such combined data sets exist, these have not yet been used to investigate route choice behaviour. A dynamic network in which travel times change over time has been used for the estimation of both recursive logit and nested models. Prediction and estimation results are compared to those obtained for a static network. The interpretation of parameter estimates and prediction accuracy differ substantially between dynamic and static networks as well as between models with correlated and uncorrelated utilities. Contrary to the static results, for the dynamic, where travel times are modelled more accurately, travel information does not have a significant impact on route choice behaviour. However, having travel information increases the travel comfort, as interviews with participants have shown.}

A combined methodology was developed, comprising of scanline-based trajectory extraction and feature-matching coordinate transformation. A scanline-based trajectory extraction technique is introduced to separate vehicle strands from pavement background on the spatial-temporal diagram by considering color features, gradient features, and motion features. Particular cleaning algorithms for removing static object noises, shadows, and occlusions are also established. Feature-matching coordinate transformation converts the pixel coordinates to the real-world coordinates to generate the physical vehicle trajectory. To evaluate the algorithm, generated trajectory results were compared to the reconstructed version of the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset. 15-min NGSIM video was divided into a 5-min dataset for the calibration and the remaining 10-min data for evaluation. Model parameters calibrated based on the 5-min video data are then applied to the 10-min testing data. Two levels of performance measurements are considered to evaluate both trajectory-level and point-level results. A reference algorithm based on mainstream motion-based detection and tracking methods are used as a baseline algorithm. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed method shows promising trajectory detection results, that on average more than 90% of vehicle trajectories are constructed by the proposed methods from the NGSIM videos. The HASDA model outperforms the reference algorithm and shows superior transferability in the training-testing experiment. Further work needs to be done to improve the algorithm performance against shadows and occlusions by incorporating more intelligent and advanced techniques.}

Arrival Manager tools aim to improve arrival flows at airports. To do so they need reliable, accurate assessments of potential congestion and delay issues. This paper sets out a methodology for predicting and evaluating the operational state of the airport arrival system. This methodology is structured in two steps: the prediction stage and the reliability stage. The prediction model is based on a Bayesian Network approach, which reflects the stochastic and time-varying nature of airport operations. It also provides insights into the interdependencies between factors contributing to airport performance. The reliability model uses a Multi-State System structure, as the airport arrival system has a large number of performance levels. It is developed via a Markov process technique. By combining these prediction and reliability models we can assess the characteristics of the airport arrival system: stationary state, availability, performance and degradation. The methodology is applied to a case study at a busy European airport, using real data from peak traffic months. Results for the scenarios analyzed show that the factors that have a greatest impact on delay and congestion are the level of saturation at arrival processes, the time frame of the day (which determines the arrival declared capacity) and the meteorological conditions. Moreover, arrival states of congestion reduce the airport’s ability to maintain optimal performance rates. The model represents an evolution from the traditional corrective and binary vision of performance analysis towards a predictive and multi-state approach. The results can be applied to derive operational strategies and draw conclusions regarding arrival performance and management.}

In this study, we propose a unified framework to design, optimize and analyze MoD operations within a multimodal transportation system where the demand for a travel mode is a function of its level of service. An application of Bayesian optimization (BO) to derive the optimal supply-side MoD parameters (e.g., fleet size and fare) is also illustrated. The proposed framework is calibrated using the taxi demand data in Manhattan, New York. Travel demand is served by public transit and MoD services of varying passenger capacities (1, 4 and 10), and passengers are predicted to choose travel modes according to a mode choice model. This choice model is estimated using stated preference data collected in New York City. The convergence of the multimodal supply-demand system and the superiority of the BO-based optimization method over earlier approaches are established through numerical experiments. We finally consider a policy intervention where the government imposes a tax on the ride-hailing service and illustrate how the proposed framework can quantify the pros and cons of such policies for different stakeholders.}

abstract = {It has been well known that properly coordinating travelers’ route choices will help mitigate urban traffic congestion. Accordingly, coordinated routing mechanisms (CRMs), functioned as coordinated network congestion management schemes, have been developed in recent years. They often employ game theory models to strategically coordinate the route decisions of a group of travelers en route with the aim to reduce network traffic congestion. However, existing studies do not provide the solution about how to form the traveler groups, such as who and how many travelers the CRMs should involve. This issue may jeopardize the efficiency and scalability of the CRMs in practical applications. To make up this gap, this study seeks to develop the clustering aided network modeling approaches to form the coordination groups (CGs), which have the proper members and sizes for supporting the merits of the congestion management schemes. Specifically, we define coordination potential as an index to indicate the potential benefit for coordinating travelers’ route decisions on network congestion reduction. Then we develop rigorous approaches to understand the mathematical features and further quantify the coordination potential between two travelers, and among multiple travelers. Built upon that, we form the CGs through a well-designed adaptive centroid-based clustering algorithm (ACCA). It secures a local optimal clustering solution, balancing the intra-cluster and inter-cluster CP, so that we can ensure a small system performance loss as we implement a CRM on each CG. The efficiency of the CG formation approach is evaluated by the CG-CRM scheme, which partitions the travelers into multiple CGs and independently coordinates the travelers’ route choices in each CG by a CRM. The numerical experiments built upon both Sioux Falls and Hardee city networks confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the CG formation approach. Mainly, the CG-CRM outperforms the independent best response routing mechanism in system performance. As compared to the CRM working on a single group involving all travelers, the CG-CRM requires significantly less computation load with a minor compromise on the system performance. This merit becomes more apparent under high penetration and congested traffic condition. Therefore, we claim that the CG formation approach will significantly help the implementation of the coordinated congestion mitigation schemes in practice.}

abstract = {Commuting vehicles are one of the most important vehicles on the road network, especially during morning and evening peak hours. Analysis of commuting vehicles can lay foundation for policy formulation, urban planning, business decision-making. A large number of license plate recognition (LPR) detectors installed on the road network have accumulated a large amount of LPR data that contain the spatio-temporal information on vehicles. Therefore, using the LPR data, the commuting behavior of vehicles can be mined and analyzed. This study takes the LPR data of Hangzhou, China as an example, a series of algorithms are used to extract a total of nine features reflecting the commuting travel behavior using the one-month LPR data, and then the factor analysis method is used to integrate the nine extracted features into three factors. The commuting behavior is characterized from three perspectives: the stability of the vehicle travel behavior during the high frequency travel time period on working days, the stability of the vehicle travel behavior during the non high frequency travel time period, the stability of the origin and destination (OD) of a vehicle during the high frequency travel time period. Based on these three factors, three methods, including the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm (DBSCAN), the iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm (ISODATA), and the fast search and find of density peaks clustering algorithm, are used to identify commuting pattern vehicles and their results are compared. Finally, the decision tree algorithm is used to extract the commuting rule and identify commuting vehicles from the collected data. After that, The influence of different high frequency travel time period on commuting rule extraction and commuting pattern vehicle recognition is carefully analyzed. The influence of randomness on the results is also tested. The proposed commuting pattern vehicle recognition algorithm is proved to be robust. The detection frequency and the first and last detected times of commuting vehicles and non commuting vehicles are then analyzed. 78.0% of commuting vehicles were first detected between 06:30 AM and 10:30 AM on each workday on average. And 77.8% of commuting vehicles were last detected between 03:30 PM and 09:30 PM on each workday on average. However, for non commuting vehicles, the phenomenon that start or end the travel during the high frequency travel time period is not obvious. This study lays a foundation for travel policy formulation. For instance, it can provide a reference for the determination of the restricted periods when implementing the travel restriction policy. In addition, the identification of commuting vehicles is extremely useful for public transit network design and optimization, and it can help the decision-making process of a customized commuter bus. In addition, these strategies are expected to reduce the use of private cars and encourage travelers to switch to public transportation.}

This paper first decomposes the mechanism into two elements – one driven by acceleration and one by time-varying CF response to disturbances – and then investigates their compounded effect. This paper also provides unifying frameworks to analyze the behavior of RVs and CAVs to facilitate analytical investigations.

abstract = {We estimate the effect of on-demand ride-hailing service market entry by Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) Uber and Lyft on per-capita vehicle ownership, energy use, travel distances, and emissions in U.S. states from 2005 to 2015 using a difference-in-difference propensity score-weighted regression model. We find evidence that TNC entry appears to cause a decline in state per-capita vehicle registrations by 3%, on average (95% confidence interval: 0.7–5.5%). Our results regarding travel distances, gasoline consumption, and several air pollutants are not conclusive, but we find evidence of a negative relationship with some EPA-estimated vehicle air emissions, representing a decline of $300 million to $900 million in externalities during the analysis period. However, these air emissions data are modeled, rather than directly measured, so we are cautious about causal interpretations, and uncertainty in the effects of TNC entry on travel distances and gasoline consumption suggests potential additional externality effects that could dominate the air emissions effect.}

abstract = {The area-based (i.e., non-lane based) heterogeneous traffic (as in developing countries) has significant differences from the lane-based homogeneous traffic (as in developed countries). In area-based traffic, drivers generally ignore the lane markings and perceive the entire road space while progressing longitudinally. The traditional car-following and lane changing models are not directly applicable to model such driving behaviour. This research aims to microscopically model the dynamics of the subject vehicle in area-based traffic flow. The modelling is conducted in two steps: area selection, and vehicle movement. In step-1, a multinomial logit (MNL) model is considered for selecting the area-based movement direction of the subject vehicle. The choice space of the subject vehicle is divided into numbers of realistic radial cones considering the possible moving directions of the subject vehicle in the next simulation time step. These radial cones form the alternatives for the decision of the subject vehicle. The attributes of the alternatives are defined in terms of angular deviation from the direction of the flow, spacing and relative speed. This model is calibrated and validated for both cars and motorcycles using real trajectory data, and the results demonstrate the good performance of the model. In step-2, a modified intelligent driving model (MIDM) is proposed to simulate the next position of the subject vehicle (along the selected direction as the outcome of the model in step-1). The parameters of the MIDM model are calibrated using real data for cars and motorcycles. The deterministic parameters for MNL model and the empirical distribution of the MIDM model parameters are utilized to stochastically simulate vehicle trajectories with the initial and boundary conditions determined by the real dataset. The comparison of the macroscopic properties between the simulated and real datasets provides promising results for the simulation applicability of the proposed modelling framework.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a bi-partitioning approach using link density data to identify an optimal restricted zone (RZ) in a congested monocentric city to assist with the implementation of area-wide congestion management strategies. A composite similarity measure is developed for each link in the network as a weighted average of a density similarity measure (ensuring homogeneity) and a distance similarity measure (ensuring connectivity and compactness). The resulting similarity matrix is fed into a graph clustering method termed symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to bi-partition the network. To determine the optimal weight as a hyperparameter, we propose a hierarchical search algorithm (HSA) based on the concept of “knee” that is used to find the most significant solution from the Pareto front. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the Melbourne network using a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model. Results show that the methodology (i) can effectively capture the spatial variations of the congestion pattern in the network; (ii) is robust to moderate parameter changes; (iii) can be extended to the time-dependent case and hence inform when to activate the area control; and (iv) can perform relatively well in the presence of missing data. When varying the distance threshold as a design parameter, we can observe how the optimal RZ evolves in space, a feature that is critical to devising a double- or multi-layered RZ for hierarchical control purposes.}

As the primary decision maker and vehicle operator, human driver is the vital component of the driving process. During the driving process, an external stimulus may trigger short-term psychological changes, and these changes are considered as the endogenous cause of many abnormal driving behaviors, which often lead to unsafe traffic disturbances and even crashes. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic long-term driving characteristics and its short-term changes after driver experiences an external stimulus. A long- and short-term driving (LSTD) model is proposed to incorporate such changes into car-following driving behavior modelling. The long-term driving characteristics are extracted through a cluster analysis, and the changes after an external stimulus are identified and measured as the indicator of the short-term driving characteristics. NGSIM data are used to demonstrate the existence of LSTD characteristics, and the soundness of the LSTD model. Two classical car-following models (i.e. the intelligent driver model, Gipps’ model) are integrated with the LSTD model, and the integrated models show a promising performance as the errors decrease by 36.7% and 35.7%, respectively.}

Three crowding metrics are considered: (1) the probability of getting a seat on boarding, (2) the expected travel time standing, and (3) the excess perceived travel time compared to uncrowded conditions. The methodology combines prediction models of passenger loads and alighting counts based on lasso regularized regression and multivariate PLS regression, a probabilistic seat allocation model and a bias correction step in order to predict the crowding metrics. Depending on data availability, the prediction method can use a combination of historical passenger counts, real-time vehicle locations and real-time passenger counts. We evaluate the prediction methodology in a real-world case study for a bus line in Stockholm, Sweden. The results indicate that personalized, predictive crowding information that is robust to varying data availability can be provided sufficiently early to be useful to travellers. The methodology is of value for agencies and operators in order to increase the attractiveness and capacity utilization of public transport.}

abstract = {In this study, we focus on how to optimize multi-type train scheduling problems in a practically available and computationally efficient manner. When solving the complicated train timetabling problem with overtaking operations for a congested high-speed rail corridor, a simplified approach is to predesignate a thin time interval from its origin station for each train. This setting is difficult and laborious in practice. What is more serious is that an imperfect setting may cause the expected solutions to be unreachable in many instances. To fundamentally get out of this thorny trouble, this study proposes a flexible scheduling framework that extends narrow time limitations to one-hour periods, which allows the trains to depart from any timestamp within the relaxed period. Further, a group of incompatibility constraints with a more compact form is formulated to mirror the coupling relation between train headway and regularity requirements. However, the relaxed time window increases the difficulty of obtaining the optimal or near-optimal solution under the standard Lagrangian-based decomposition framework. Therefore, an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is introduced for effectively eliminating the computational barriers that are due to its increased complexity. Specifically, a priority-based search sequence is employed by applying the associated dual costs during the solution of train-level path subproblems individually. Finally, a set of numerical experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and availability of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {This paper considers offline dynamic OD (origin-destination) calibration problems for large-scale simulation-based network models. We formulate the problem as a simulation-based optimization (SO) problem and propose a scalable and efficient metamodel SO algorithm. For a network with n links and a problem with T time intervals and Z OD pairs per time interval, the corresponding SO problem is a high-dimensional problem of dimension T·Z. At each iteration of the SO algorithm, we solve a set of T independent analytical and differentiable metamodel optimization problems, each of dimension Z. The T analytical problems are constrained by n nonlinear equality constraints. Hence, they scale linearly with the number of links in the network and independently of other network attributes, such as the dimension of the route choice set or the link lengths. The temporal correlation, of the link performance metrics across time intervals, is approximately captured through the parameters of the metamodel. Since the T analytical optimization problems are decoupled and can be solved independently, the proposed approach scales independently of the number of calibration time intervals, making it suitable for the calibration of demand over numerous time periods. The approach is efficient and scalable. It is suitable to address high-dimensional calibration problems for large-scale network models. It is benchmarked on both a toy network and a Singapore network versus two general-purpose algorithms: SPSA and a derivative-free pattern search algorithm. The validation experiments indicate that the proposed method identifies points with objective function estimates that outperform the benchmark methods by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. As the problem dimension and the temporal correlation, across time intervals, increase, so does the magnitude by which the proposed method outperforms the benchmark methods. The Singapore case study considers a problem of dimension 16,200. This is 2 orders of magnitude higher than what is currently considered high-dimensional for continuous SO problems. The proposed method identifies solutions with an estimated objective function that is 1 order of magnitude better than those of the benchmark methods. It yields solutions that provide an average, across time intervals, improvement to link counts of 77%, compared to the benchmark methods. The case study also illustrates the robustness of the method to the quality of the initial points.}

While this type of data is relatively inexpensive to gather, it can pose multiple privacy risks, even if the location tracks are anonymous. In particular, an issue could be the possibility for an attacker to infer user location tracks from anonymous location data, which affects users privacy. In this article, we propose a new framework for analyzing a variety of privacy problems arising in transportation systems. The state of traffic is modeled by the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards traffic flow model, which is a first order scalar conservation law with a concave flux function. Given a set of traffic flow data, we show that the constraints resulting from this partial differential equation are mixed integer linear inequalities for some decision variable. These constraints allow us to determine the likelihood of two distinct location tracks being generated by the same vehicle. We then use these model-based reidentification metrics to train an artificial neural network classifier. Numerical implementations are performed on experimental data from the Mobile Century experiment, and show that this framework significantly outperforms naive reidentification techniques.}

Multivariate analysis of grouped motifs data shows different preference of motifs for students, part-time workers, retirees, telecommuters, drivers, women, and younger adults. In the second portion of the analysis, motifs are grouped into categories based on the number of locations a person visits in a day and their correlation with time use and travel is explored. Time use and travel are analyzed based on minute-by-minute time allocation pattern identification using sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering. The correlation between motifs group and sequence analysis finds substantial heterogeneity within the motif groups. The within motif group clusters of activity-based sequences show typical commuting, going to school, and resting patterns. We also find seven patterns that are not typical but have similarities across motifs in their temporal footprint and the variety of activities in each sequence.

Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) data is now being used to allow vehicles to cooperate better with current and future environments, such as traffic conditions, signal timing, and terrain information. This study proposes an eco-drive algorithm for vehicle fuel consumption optimization on rolling terrains, which frequently causes additional fuel waste due to the inefficient transformation between kinetic and potential energy. The algorithm using the Relaxed Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (RPMP) is computationally efficient and applicable in real time. While similar algorithms have proven effective in simulations with many assumptions, it is necessary to test these algorithms in the field to better understand the algorithm performance and thus make enhancements to optimally control vehicles for eco-drive. Therefore, this study further tested and verified the newly developed algorithms on an innovative CAV platform and quantified the fuel saving benefits of eco-drive. The proposed eco-drive system is compared against conventional constant speed cruise control on a total of 7 road segments over 47 miles. Experimental data shows that more than 20 percent of fuel consumption can be saved. Detailed analysis through linear models also reveal the main geometrical contributors to the eco-drive fuel savings. This finding can provide a rough estimate of the fuel saving potential of given roadways and help state departments of transportation to identify roadways where eco-drive should be implemented. The algorithm and the experiment can also support original equipment manufacturers in developing and marketing this technology to reduce fuel consumption and emissions in the future.}

To address this concern, this paper proposes a decentralized control model for connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at an isolated signalized intersection with a single-lane road where each connected automated vehicle aims to minimize its own travel time, fuel consumption and safety risks. To improve the computational tractability, the original complex decentralized control model is reformulated into a discrete model. A benchmark centralized control model is also formulated to compare with the decentralized control model. The DIRECT algorithm is adopted to solve the above models. Numerical results show that the decentralized control model has better computational efficiency (with an average solution time of 10 s) than the centralized control model (with an average solution time of 60 s) without significant loss of the system optimality (with an average of 3.91%). Finally, analysis on connected automated vehicle market penetration shows that the extra benefit of the centralized control model is not obvious either in under-saturated traffic (less than 1%) or at a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate in critically-saturated and over-saturated traffic (less than 3% when the market penetration rate is lower than 20%). The results suggest that, as apposed to the earlier concern, the near-future decentralized control scheme that requires less technology maturity and infrastructure investment can achieve benefits similar to the far-future centralized control scheme with much simpler operations in under-saturated traffic, or in critically-saturated traffic and over-saturated traffic with a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate.}

Managing such a complex multi-modal system requires a holistic modeling framework of transportation network flow in terms of both passenger flow and vehicular flow. In this paper, we formulate and solve for spatio-temporal passenger and vehicular flows in a general multi-modal network explicitly considering multi-class vehicles, parking facilities, and various travel modes. Vehicular flows, namely cars, trucks, and buses, are integrated into a holistic dynamic network loading (DNL) model. Travel behavior of passenger demand on modes and routes choices is encapsulated by a multi-layer nested logit model. We formulate the multi-modal dynamic user equilibrium (MMDUE) that can be cast into a Variational Inequality (VI) problem. A simple flow solution performed at the origin-destination level and based on the gradient projection is derived from the KKT conditions and shown to efficiently solve for the VI problem on large-scale networks. Numerical experiments are conducted on a multi-modal network in the Pittsburgh region along with sensitivity analysis with respect to demand and management strategies. We show that many factors including the total passenger demand, parking prices, transit fare, and ride-sharing impedance can effectively impact the system performance and individual user costs. Experiments on a large-scale multi-modal network in Fresno, California also show our model and solution algorithm have satisfactory convergence performance and computational efficiency.}

We first propose a bi-objective optimization model to maximize (1) the on-time arrival reliability and (2) energy-efficiency for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in a path finding problem. The former objective requires finding the reliable shortest path (RSP), which is the path with the minimal effective travel time measured by the sum of the mean travel time and a travel time safety margin for any given origin-destination (OD) pair. Then, we refer to energy-efficiency as the minimum of the electric energy consumption. We discuss the non-additive property of the RSP problem since we also consider the link travel time correlations, whereas the latter objective satisfies the additive criterion. To this end, we illustrate the existence of non-dominated solutions that satisfy both of the two objectives. Furthermore, it is shown that the intersection of two candidate sets – one for the RSPs and the other for paths with minimal energy-consumption - actually contains the optimal solution for the bi-objective optimization problem. The upper and lower bounds of the effective travel time are mathematically deduced and can be used to generate the candidate path set of this bi-objective problem via the K-shortest algorithm. Our proposed algorithm overcomes the infeasibility of traditional path finding algorithms (e.g., the Dijkstra algorithm) for RSPs. Moreover, using two numerical examples, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. We numerically demonstrate promising potential applications of the proposed algorithm in real-life road traffic networks.}

The realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply “drones” have been proposed as a pioneering tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics, but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion. A swarm of 10 drones hovering over the central business district of Athens over multiple days to record traffic streams in a congested area of a 1.3 km2 area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100 busy intersections (signalized or not), many bus stops and close to half a million trajectories. The aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena. The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors. This open science initiative creates a unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude higher than what was available till now, that researchers from different disciplines around the globe can use to develop and test their own models.}

In this study, a new method is developed based on GPS data to identify typical business activity-travel patterns and characterise the travel behaviour of a specific vehicle and corresponding drivers. Using GPS data collected from the real operation of 6,500 commercial vehicles over a period of three months, the proposed method was tested. In total, five profiles were constructed, accommodating activity-travel patterns associated with vans, cars, trucks-35 t (light trucks), trucks-3ax (medium trucks), and buses. Similarities and differences in these profiles across vehicle types were revealed, and specific locations corresponding to the activities of the patterns were further examined. Moreover, using these profiles as a reference, the travel practice of a specific vehicle was evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the approach in depicting business travel patterns, providing a deep understanding of business travel behaviour, and assisting the design and evaluation of policies for more sustainable business transport.}

abstract = {The use of smartphone applications (apps) to acquire real time and readily available journey planning information is becoming instinctive behavior by public transport (PT) users. Through the apps, a passenger not only seeks a path from origin to destination, but a satisfactory path that caters to the passenger’s preferences at the desired time of travel. Essentially, apps attempt to provide a means of personalized PT service. As the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic take form and infiltrate human and environmental interactions, passenger preference personalization will likely include avoiding risks of infection or contagious contact. The personal preferences are enabled by multiple attributes associated with alternative PT routes. For instance, preferences can be connected to attributes of time, cost, and convenience. This work establishes a personalized PT service, as an adjustment to current design frameworks, by integrating user app experience with operators’ data sources and operations modeling. The work proceeds to focus on its key component: the personalized route guidance methodology. In addition to using the existing shortest path or k-weighted shortest path method, this study develops a novel, lexicographical shortest path method, considering a just noticeable difference (JND). The method adopts lexicographical ordering to capture passenger preferences for different PT attributes following Ernst Weber’s law of human perception threshold. However, a direct application of Weber’s law violates the axiom of transitivity required for an implementable algorithm, and thus, a revised method is developed with proven algorithms for ranking different paths. The differences between the three route-guidance methods and the effects of the JND perception threshold on the order of the alternative PT routes are demonstrated with an example. The developments were examined in a case study by simulation on the Copenhagen PT network. The results show that using the JND method reduces the value/cost of the most important attributes. Identical robust results are attained when JND parameters are not specified and default values are used. The latter may apply for the future with a mixture of specified and default preference input values. Finally, the computation time indicates a favorable potential for real-life applications. It is believed that the consideration of human threshold perception will encourage decision makers to establish new criteria to comply with this.}

abstract = {In the era of smart cities, Internet of Things, and Mobility-as-a-Service, private operators need to share data with public agencies to support data exchanges for “living lab” ecosystems more than ever before. However, it is still problematic for private operators to share data with the public due to risks to competitive advantages. A privacy control algorithm is proposed to overcome this key obstacle for private operators sharing complex network-oriented data objects. The algorithm is based on information-theoretic k-anonymity and, using tour data as an example, where an operator’s data is used in conjunction with performance measure accuracy controls to synthesize a set of alternative tours with diffused probabilities for sampling during a query. The algorithm is proven to converge sublinearly toward a constrained maximum entropy under certain asymptotic conditions with measurable gap. Computational experiments verify the applicability to multi-vehicle fleet tour data; they confirm that reverse engineered parameters from the diffused data result in controllable sampling error; and tests conducted on a set of realistic routing records from travel data in Long Island, NY, demonstrate the use of the methodology from both the adversary and user perspectives.}

abstract = {Ridesourcing services provided by companies like Uber, Lyft, and Didi have grown rapidly over the past decade and now serve a sizable portion of trips in many metropolitan areas. An understanding of these services (e.g. to whom, where, when, and for what purposes do they provide service?) is critical for regulating, planning, and managing urban multi-modal transportation systems effectively. Unfortunately, little is known about ridesourcing travel because private companies providing ridesourcing services were not previously subject to data sharing requirements. Fortunately, the city of Chicago recently collected and released spatially (census tract) and temporally (15-minute interval) aggregated data on ridesourcing trips collected from private companies. This study analyzes the Chicago ridesourcing data to examine factors influencing ridesourcing usage. The study employs a random-effects negative binomial (RENB) regression approach to model ridesourcing usage. Determinants considered in the model include weekend vs. weekday and weather variables as well as census tract socio-demographics and commute characteristics, land-use variables, places of interest, transit supply, parking features, and crime. The model results indicate ridesourcing demand is higher on days when temperatures are lower, there is less precipitation, and on the weekend, as well as in census tracts with (i) higher household incomes, (ii) a higher percentage of workers who carpool or take transit to work, (iii) a higher percentage of households with zero vehicles, (iv) higher population and employment density, (v) higher land-use diversity, (vi) fewer parking spots and higher parking rates, (vii) more restaurants, and (viii) more homicides. The results also demonstrate a non-linear (and insightful) relationship between ridesourcing demand and transit supply variables. The paper discusses the implications of these model results to inform transportation planning and policymaking as well as future research.}
